## 5 Effect of schooling on the learn drive

## 学校教育对学习内驱力的影响

Coercive schooling suppresses the learn drive and results in diminished long-term effect of learning.

强制性的学校教育抑制了学生的学习内驱力，降低了学生的长期学习效果。

### 5.1 Learn drive vs. age

### 学习内驱力与年龄

**The learn drive is a vital instinct that underlies the adaptive development of the central nervous system**. Babies scan their environment for elements of novelty. This is a way of searching for and detecting things that are worth learning. A baby may randomly search the space above its head until it finds a moving object. This object may be classified as novelty from which a child can learn something. At a certain stage of development, the baby will taste all objects around it in order to learn what might be edible. A kid in a room of toys will zero in on a toy that he will deem as a best satisfier of young mind's curiosity. The [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) is a powerful brain mechanism that gave babies their label of [never-ceasing perfect learning machines](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_baby_brain_does_not_work).

**学习内驱力是中枢神经系统适应发展的重要本能**。婴儿在他们的环境中寻找新奇的元素。这是一种寻找和发现值得学习的东西的方法。婴儿可以在头上的空间里随机搜索，直到找到一个移动的物体。这个物体可以归类为新奇的东西，孩子可以从中学到东西。在发育的某一阶段，婴儿会品尝周围所有的东西，以便了解什么是可以吃的。一个孩子在一屋子玩具里，会把注意力集中在一件玩具上，他认为这是最能满足年轻心灵好奇心的玩具。[学习内驱力](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive)是一种强大的大脑机制，给婴儿们贴上了[永不停止的完美学习机器](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_baby_brain_does_not_work)的标签。

Some scientists believe that we innately lose our novelty seeking and our [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) with age. This claim is dangerously wrong. There are indeed many indicators of decline. An adult is no longer fascinated with all things that move. He will find a room of toys boring. He will spit out new tastes and often hate new dishes. Someone, who has never tasted a snail or a beetle, isn't likely to learn to love dishes based on snails or insects. Older people no longer show fascination with the world that is so typical to a young knowledge-hungry student. Older people's passions seem to be on a steady decline with age.

一些科学家认为，随着年龄的增长，我们自然地就失去了求新的欲望和[学习内驱力](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive)。这种说法是危险的错误。确实有许多下降的迹象。成年人不再对所有会动的东西着迷。他会觉得一屋子玩具很无聊。他会吐出未尝过味道，经常讨厌新菜。从来没有吃过蜗牛或甲虫的人不太可能喜欢吃蜗牛或昆虫做的菜。对于渴望知识的年轻学生来说，这个世界是很典型的，但年长者不再对这个世界感兴趣。随着年龄的增长，年长者的热情似乎在稳步下降。

### 5.2 Learn drive vs. knowledge

### 学习内驱力与知识

**The main factor that undermines the learn drive with age is the established knowledge**. There are also secondary factors such as \(1\) declining "attractive power" of the current knowledge and \(2\) the actual aging of the brain. Aging may result in a decline in neural networks, synaptic pruning, lesser mental energy, etc. Those can be largely prevented with mental hygiene and learning itself. It is possible to retain the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) and passion for learning till the age of hundred. With healthy lifestyle, it is easier to retain vitality of the brain than it is to retain, for example, the vitality of the motor system.

**随着年龄的增长，削弱学习内驱力的主要因素是已掌握的知识**。还有一些次要因素，如（1）当前知识的「吸引力」下降，（2）大脑的实际老化。老化可能会导致神经网络的老化、突触削减、精神活力的减少等。这些都可以通过精神保健和学习本身来预防。[学习内驱力](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive)和热情可以一直保持到百岁。在健康的生活方式中，保持大脑的活力比保持运动系统的活力更容易。

Some of novelty seeking may be part of a developmental program \(e.g. baby's taste-seeking stage\). However, those programs would not play an essential part of explorations we tend to induce in the young generation in the course of their education.

一些求新欲可能是发育过程的一部分（例如，婴儿的味觉探索阶段）。然而，这些过程并没有在我们试图引导年轻一代在教育课程中进行的探索中发挥重要作用。

Knowledge itself is the most powerful extinguisher of the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive). It can be illustrated with our interest in a particular book. A book is interesting in the first read. We are rarely interested in reading the book for the second time. Re-reading what we know is rarely exciting. Overtime, with some help from forgetting, the book may become interesting again. A forgotten book may reactivate reward circuits via the learn drive guidance system. Once the knowledge is established, it takes away the incentive to seek new knowledge. Forgetting is also helpful in other areas, e.g. the emotional effects of a song on the radio. The difference is that music is far less about declarative memory and far more about patterns and beauty. Like a nice sunset. You do not need to forget one to love another. This is why a catchy tune can stay addictive despite multiple replays, while a jazzy or classical masterpiece can retain its appeal for life if not played ad nauseam.

知识本身就是学习内驱力最强大的[灭火器](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive)。这可以用我们对某本书的兴趣来说明。一本书初读时很有趣。我们很少有兴趣把这本书再读一遍。重读我们所知道的东西很少令人兴奋。随着时间的推移，在遗忘的作用下，这本书可能会再次变得有趣。被遗忘的书可以通过学习内驱力引导系统重新激活奖励回路。一旦知识建立起来，就失去了寻找新知识的动力。遗忘在其他方面也有帮助，比如收音机里一首歌的情绪影响。不同之处在于，音乐与陈述性记忆的关系要小得多，而与模式和美感的关系要大得多。就像美丽的日落。你不需要忘记一次日落去爱另一次日落。这就是为什么一首朗朗上口的曲子即使多次重放也能让人上瘾，而一首爵士或古典名乐即使不被反复播放，也能让人永生难忘。

Knowledge undermines novelty. There is no novelty seeking brain center that would specifically decline with age. There is no novelty seeking extinguishing program activated in development. Novelty of an area of knowledge disappears once an area of ignorance is filled up.

知识的增加会破坏求新欲。神经中枢随着年龄的增加不会削减一个人的求新欲。 这种求新欲也不会随着一个人的发展而泯灭。 但当一个人在某一个的知识领域的无知被填满后，他的求新欲也随之消散

The good news coming from our understanding of the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) is that it can be employed in lifelong passionate education. Learning can be as much fun at 80 as it is at 15.

我们对[学习内驱力](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive)的理解带来的好消息是，学习内驱力可以在终生的激情教育中起作用。80 岁的时候学习和 15 岁的时候一样有趣。

### 5.3 Learn drive vs. learning

### 学习内驱力与学习

The main trick we can employ in keeping the learning passion alive is constant learning itself. Learning fills up the brain with new knowledge. However, it also identifies and magnifies the areas of ignorance. By an appropriate selection of the learning material, we can constantly look for new areas to fill up. This is best done with [self-directed learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_history:_school_vs._self-directed_learning). Only a learner herself can effectively identify the areas of knowledge, the areas of ignorance, and the areas in-between that are suitable for learning.

保持学习热情的主要技巧是不断学习本身。学习使大脑充满新知识。然而，它也识别和扩大了不懂的领域。通过选择合适的学习材料，我们可以不断地寻找新的领域来填补。这是[自我导向学习](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_history:_school_vs._self-directed_learning)的最佳方式。只有学习者自己才能有效地识别出知道的领域、不懂的领域以及中间适合学习的领域。

Learning at school violates the principles of efficient learning by taking away the control from the learn drive guidance system. Passive learning at school will often hit the areas of established knowledge, which will make it boring. It will often hit areas of ignorance, which will make it incomprehensible. Rarely will it accurately hit the areas where new fascinating knowledge can expand the knowledge tree.

在学校的学习通过夺去学习内驱力引导系统的控制，违反了有效学习的原则。在学校被动学习往往会触及已知的知识领域，这将使它变得无聊。它常常会触及不懂的领域，使之难以理解。它很少能准确地触及到那些可以从已有的知识树中扩展出去的新知识。

> **Passive pre-programmed learning at school suppresses the learn drive**.
>
> **学校的被动预编课程学习会抑制学习内驱力。**

Metaphorically speaking, teachers throw pieces of knowledge at students and hope some of that knowledge sticks. Usually, it does not. Most of the courseware material is gone in a month. After a year, only repetition, review, duplication, and exams help a fraction of that knowledge survive in the brain. [Self-directed learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_history:_school_vs._self-directed_learning) based on the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) is extremely precise in rejecting unsuitable knowledge or finding those places in the knowledge tree that can adapt new portion of knowledge that fit the need.

打个比方说，老师把一段段知识扔给学生，希望他们能从中学到一些东西。通常情况并非如此。大多数课件材料在一个月内就用完了。一年后，只有重复、复习、重复和考试才能帮助部分知识在大脑中保存下来。基于[学习内驱力](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive)的[自我导向学习](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_history:_school_vs._self-directed_learning)在拒绝不合适的知识或找到可以从已有的知识树中扩展出去的新知识方面是非常精确的。

This is one of the biggest ailments of schooling: students keep complaining that school is too boring or school is too hard. Students are not happy, and this works against the system. This problem cannot be effectively resolved if we retain the old classroom learning system. It is impossible to optimize learning in a group of students who will always diverge in their knowledge due to different passions, different interests, different talents, and different learning speeds. The only effective optimization solution is [**self-directed learning**](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_history:_school_vs._self-directed_learning).

这是学校教育的最大弊病之一：学生们总是抱怨学校太无聊或太辛苦。学生们不快乐，这与系统背道而驰。如果我们保持旧的课堂学习制度，这个问题就不能被有效地解决。在一个总是因为不同的激情、不同的兴趣、不同的天赋、不同的学习速度而导致知识差异的群体中，优化学习是不可能的。唯一有效的优化解决方案是[**自我导向学习**](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_history:_school_vs._self-directed_learning)。

### 5.4 Teacher problem

### 老师的困境

A well-intentioned teacher may also contribute to the suppression of the learn drive even while facilitating self-directed learning.

一个善意的老师在促进自主学习的同时，也可能抑制学习内驱力。

If a child has a question _"Where is New York? In which country?"_, a natural instinct of a parent or teacher is to provide the answer. If the child is exposed to the same question frequently enough, she will be able recall the answer on her own. Otherwise, she will need help again. Overall effect of such review would be similar to review in [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo), except it would come naturally without the extra cost of the interaction with a computer, and it would come in a random manner without optimizing for the memory effect of each review. This type of interaction has both suppressive and enhancing effect on the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive). The interest in New York as part of the USA will gradually decline as the fact becomes known, i.e. no longer new. The interest in things related to the USA may increase in proportion to the interest in New York. The interest in things related to New York may increase in proportion to the interest in the USA.

如果一个孩子有一个问题「*纽约在哪里？在哪个国家？*」，父母或老师的自然本能是提供答案。如果孩子经常面对同样的问题，她将能够自己回忆起答案。否则，她将再次需要帮助。这种复习的整体效果类似于 [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo) 中的复习，只不过它是自然产生的，没有与计算机交互的额外成本，而且它是随机产生的，没有优化每次复习的记忆效果。这种互动对[学习内驱力](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive)既有抑制作用又有增强作用。随着事实逐渐被记住，人们对纽约作为美国一部分的兴趣也会逐渐减退，即不再是新鲜事。对美国相关事物的兴趣可能会随着对纽约兴趣的增加而增加。对纽约相关事物的兴趣可能会与对美国的兴趣成比例增加。

A far more interesting interaction occurs when the child **does not** receive an instant feedback from a teacher. The question may remain unanswered, and knowledge will not increase. However, all questions asked that get no instant response contribute to the learn drive. The location of New York remains a mystery, which will get more interesting with each exposure. The increase in interest will progress along formulas similar to those that govern the increase in [long-term memory stability](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_stability) \(as predicted by the [two component model](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Two_component_model_of_memory)\). The increase in stability of interest does not have an immediate contribution to knowledge, but it has a powerful impact on the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive). The child will be curious to explore and find out on its own in a competitive process where all areas of interest will compete for child's focus that will be context dependent. For example, in the context of biology, New York might not even light up in memory. However, in the context of map inspection, or a geographic documentary, the question may pop up again and drive further explorations. Once the child finds answers to a burning question, i.e. a question with a high degree of relative importance burnt stable in memory, the reward of learning becomes magnified. The pleasure of learning increases. The reward propagates in associative memory and enhances positive associations related to knowing New York, knowing the US, and knowing things related to both. This is a reward propagation cascade whose depth depends on the level of reward and the original degree of curiosity. That cascade involves memory consolidation. This way, by not answering a question, a teacher may potentially increase consolidation in a larger areas of memory networks. By definition, this reduces the need for review of knowledge in the entire learning process.

当孩子**没有**从老师那里得到及时的反馈时，就会发生更有趣的互动。这个问题也许仍未得到解答，知识也不会增加。然而，所有没有得到即时回应的问题都有助于学习内驱力。纽约的位置仍然是个谜，每次遇到这个问题都会让它变得更加有趣。兴趣的增加将符合一个公式，这个公式类似于[长期记忆稳定性](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_stability)增长公式（正如[双组件记忆模型](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Two_component_model_of_memory)所预测的那样）。兴趣稳定性的提高并不会对知识产生立竿见影的贡献，但会对[学习内驱力](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive)产生强大的影响。孩子会在一个具有竞争性的过程中探索和发现，在这个过程中，所有的兴趣点都会吸引孩子的注意力，而孩子的注意力是依赖于背景的。例如，在生物学的背景下，纽约甚至可能不会在记忆中被点亮。然而，在查看地图或看地理纪录片的背景下，这个问题可能会再次出现，并推动进一步的探索。一旦孩子找到了那个强烈的问题的答案，即一个相对重要程度较高的问题在记忆中强烈持续过，学习的奖励就会被放大。学习的乐趣增加了。奖励在联想记忆中增殖，并增强了对了解纽约、了解美国以及了解与这两者有关的事物的积极联想。这是一个奖励增殖级联（多个对象之间的关联），其深度取决于奖励的水平和原始的好奇心程度。这种级联包括记忆巩固。通过这种方式，通过不回答问题，老师可以潜在地增加记忆网络中更大区域的巩固。显然，这减少了在整个学习过程中复习知识的需要。

> Providing children with answers to their own questions can also be suppressive for the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive). In contrast, leaving questions unanswered may propel the young brain into rewarding explorations that will feed further progress.
>
> 回答孩子们自己提出的问题的答案也会抑制[学习内驱力](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive)。相比较，不回答问题可能会促使年轻的大脑进行有益的探索，从而促进更长远的进步。

This does not mean we should leave all questions unanswered. There are two factors that should prompt an answer from a teacher:

1. the kid is absolutely crazy to know and his curiosity has been driven red hot. In terms of propagation and consolidation, there isn't much to gain. New branches of learn drive seeds will pop up and prompt further research
2. the question is of highly fundamental nature in that in underlies many other vital pieces of knowledge that may be hard or slow to get on one's own. Fundamental questions are of universal nature and get re-consolidated by the sheer progression of learning into new areas. They simply come up in explorations over and over again

这并不意味着我们应该对所有问题置之不理。有两个因素可以提示老师给出答案：

1. 那个孩子已经发了疯地想知道且他的好奇心已经被激发到了极点。从增殖和巩固的角度来看，不会有太多收获。学习内驱力种子的新分支将会出现，并促使进一步的探究。
2. 这个问题具有高度基础性，因为它是许多其他重要知识的基础，而这些知识可能很难或只能缓慢地靠自学得到。基本问题具有普遍性，并通过学习进入新领域而得到重新巩固。它们只是在探索中不断出现。

### 5.5 Learn drive distortions

### 学习内驱力扭曲

There are dangers and inherent inefficiencies in the learn drive guidance system. It can easily be tricked into seeing novelty in areas which we would not classify as desirable. For an average student, the game of checkers quickly gets boring. To a sophisticated mind, a game of chess is more fun but it also may easily get boring. To a grandmaster, who can see chess as a colorful pattern of chessboard combinations with mnemonic stories that rival the most interesting book of history, chess may be a never-ending source of fascination. In other words, a chessboard and a few chess pieces can feed novelty seeking system with rewarding stimuli for eternity.

学习内驱力引导系统存在一定的危险性和固有的低效性。我们很容易被骗去看一些我们并不感兴趣的领域的新奇事物。对于一个普通的学生来说，跳棋游戏很快就变得无聊了。对于一个老练的人来说，下国际象棋更有趣，但也可能很容易变得无聊。对于一个能把国际象棋看作是棋盘和记忆故事相结合而成的丰富多彩的图案的大师来说，国际象棋可能是一种永无止境的魅力源泉。换句话说，一个棋盘和几副棋子可以为求新欲系统提供无穷无尽的奖励刺激。

For a teen, a video game can easily employ the trick of a chess game by dragging a young mind into an endless labyrinth of new levels to explore and new combinations of tools or situations that never seem to get boring. With a competitive factor in teams, games can be addictive and dangerous.

对于一个十几岁的孩子来说，电子游戏可以很容易地运用国际象棋的技巧，通过把一个年轻的大脑拖进一个有无尽新关卡去探索的迷宫，和新的工具或情况组合，这些似乎永远不会变得枯燥。有了团队中的竞争因素，游戏可能会让人上瘾，也可能很危险。

In an adult, a passion for his favorite sport may also provide a never ending source of fascinating knowledge. One football league, from year to year, can provide all imaginable combination of outcomes, players, field combinations, strategies, personal stories, etc.

对于一个成年人来说，对他最喜爱的运动的热情也可能为他提供无穷无尽的迷人的知识源泉。一个足球联赛，年复一年，可以提供所有可以想象的结果组合，球员，场地组合，策略，个人故事，等等。

The above means that we cannot bank on [self-directed learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_history:_school_vs._self-directed_learning) to always feed our minds with useful knowledge. Social media thrives on gossip and trivia. Both teens and adults can sink untold hours in Facebook without coming up with useful goods. We seem to never get bored with social interaction and mobile phones keep buzzing with a chatter that satisfies our novelty cravings.

综上所述，我们不能指望[自我导向学习](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_history:_school_vs._self-directed_learning)总是用有用的知识来充实我们的头脑。社交媒体因八卦和琐事而繁荣。青少年和成年人都可能在 Facebook 上消磨数不清的时间，却找不到有用的东西。我们似乎从来不会对社交互动感到厌烦，手机里不停地传来各种各样的闲聊声，满足了我们对新奇事物的渴望。

For many kids with talents, [self-directed learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_history:_school_vs._self-directed_learning) is all that is needed to soar. The universal formula for all kids for a drive in the quest for valuable knowledge is [**self-directed learning**](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_history:_school_vs._self-directed_learning) **with a dose of trajectory-nudging guidance from any corrector system**. This corrector can come from a parent, from a teacher, or from a peer \(incl. older peers\). The trajectory corrector needs to be **placed in the optimum** [**push zone**](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Push_zone) to ensure correct trajectory without upsetting the system. Naturally, there is no better corrector than mature self-awareness with a pinch of self-discipline. An educated adult should understand the need for lifelong learning and understand the right direction for his learning to progress. Ideally, life itself is the best corrector of the learning trajectory.

对于许多有天赋的孩子来说，[自我导向学习](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_history:_school_vs._self-directed_learning)是他们腾飞所需要的。对于所有寻求有价值知识的孩子来说，通用的方法是，**在任何校正系统的引导下**[**自我导向学习**](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_history:_school_vs._self-directed_learning)**。**这个校正者可以是父母、老师或同龄人（包括年长的同龄人）。学习轨迹校正器需要**在**[**最佳推动区**](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Push_zone)，以确保正确的学习轨迹而又不会扰乱系统。当然，没有比成熟的自我意识更好的校正者，只有一点自律。受过教育的成年人应该理解终身学习的必要性，并理解学习进步的正确方向。理想情况下，生活本身是学习轨迹的最佳校正器。

### 5.6 School enthusiasm

### 上学热情

School suppresses the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) and it may result in dangerous long-term neural adaptation that may skew young personalities for life. I write about it in the [following section](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learned_helplessness_vs._learn_drive).

学校抑制[学习内驱力](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive)，这可能导致危险的长期神经适应，这可能会扭曲年轻人的一生。我在[下面的章节](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learned_helplessness_vs._learn_drive)中写了这件事。

> With an amazing regularity, I started all my schools with great expectations and in happy anticipation. That was the case in the primary school, high school, and both my colleges. In all cases, the enthusiasm was gone fast. Often after the first day or the first lecture! However, there were moments when the opposite process occurred. When I was thrown away from one school, on disciplinary grounds, I came to a new one with lowest expectations. This actually helped me rise for a while. With a help of a [good teacher](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Great_teachers_change_the_world), I had a few months of a great school adventure. Similarly, a great teacher or [freedom of self-directed learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_history:_school_vs._self-directed_learning) helped me extract some fun from schools later on. If I was to simulate my own life over and over again in conditions of Polish schools, it would be loss of love of learning most of the time. The opposite happy process is reserved for a lucky few who hit lucky circumstances or lucky own predispositions.

> 历史总是惊人的相似，我怀着极大的期望和快乐的期待开始了我所有的学校生活。小学、中学和我的两所大学都是这样。在所有情况下，热情都很快消失了。通常在第一天或第一堂课之后！然而，有时会出现相反的过程。当我因为纪律原因被一所学校开除时，我来到了一所期望值最低的新学校。这实际上帮助我提升了一段时间的热情。在一位[好老师](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Great_teachers_change_the_world)的帮助下，我度过了几个月的学校历险。同样，一位伟大的老师或[自我导向学习的自由](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_history:_school_vs._self-directed_learning)在后来帮助我从学校中获得了一些乐趣。如果我在波兰的学校里一遍又一遍地模拟我自己的生活，大部分时间我都会失去对学习的热爱。与之相反的快乐过程只留给少数幸运的人，他们遇到了幸运的环境或幸运的自己的倾向。

> Conversely, the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) can be suppressed with [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo). If the student stops learning new things and only keeps retaining old knowledge in SuperMemo, forgetting will prune all attractive surfaces on the knowledge tree. Only the dry core will remain in SuperMemo. While knowledge maintained with active learning and [incremental learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_learning) resembles a lively tree full of hungry tendrils, dead knowledge maintained with SuperMemo is like a rejected Christmas tree with ever decreasing number of dried out branch endings. For an advanced learner, the effort that comes with [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition) may still evoke the [pleasure of knowing](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Pleasure_of_knowing). However, this kind of pleasure is best ignited with the actual use of the learned knowledge. Regurgitating old knowledge with no new material has the same suppressive effect as schooling. Similarly, it undermines the love of learning. If you happen to experience a decline of your love of repetitions, add new value to your collection, and redistribute old material in manageable portions into the future. This should apply primarily to old unused exam material that you retain half-heartedly without a true conviction about its usefulness.

> 反过来，[学习内驱力](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive)有可能被 [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo) 抑制。如果学生停止学习新事物，只在 SuperMemo 中保留旧知识，遗忘会删除知识树上所有吸引人的表面。只有干芯会留在 SuperMemo 中。用主动学习和[渐进学习](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_learning)来维持知识就像一棵充满饥饿卷须的生气勃勃的树，而用 SuperMemo 来维持的死知识就像一棵被丢弃的圣诞树，枯干的树枝末端的数量在不断减少。对于一个高级学习者来说，[间隔重复](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition)所带来的努力可能仍然会唤起[认知的乐趣](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Pleasure_of_knowing)。然而，这种快乐最好通过实际运用所学知识来激发。在没有新材料的情况下，死记硬背旧知识与上学具有同样的抑制作用。同样，它破坏了对学习的热爱。如果你不再喜欢重复，那就给你的收藏增加新的价值，并将旧的材料以容易管理的分量重新分配到将来。这应该主要适用于旧的未使用的考试材料，你对这些材料的用处没有真正的信心，只是敷衍了事。

#### 5.7.3 Learn drive at middle age

#### 中年的学习内驱力

Instead of noticing a decline in my own learning passions, I observe the reverse. This is why I violently disagree with researchers who tend to attribute the decline in [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) to chronological age. I employ [incremental learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_learning) to keep my passion for learning alive. I explain how it works for me in a personal note below.

我没有注意到自己学习热情的下降，而是观察到了相反的情况。这就是为什么我强烈反对研究人员将[学习内驱力](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive)下降归因于年龄。我采用[渐进学习](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_learning)来保持我对学习的热情。我在下面的个人笔记中解释了它是如何对我起作用的。

> I was never too interested in history, in a [chapter devoted to self-directed learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_history:_school_vs._self-directed_learning), I explain that my learning can be divided into three stages:

> 1. learning at school with zero efficiency,
> 2. learning with SuperMemo with some progress, and
> 3. employment of [incremental reading](http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_learning) that truly exploded my understanding of history.

> I keep saying "_the greater the clearing the greater the perimeter_". The more I know, the more I know I don't know. Understanding one's ignorance is the best drive for more learning, and the more I know, the more painful the ignorance is. Forgetting plays a role too. I keep getting angry with realizations that even a kid in primary school knows things I do not know. Even a 5-year-old can ask better questions. I think those realizations will keep my passion for learning alive for as long as I retain my solid mental faculties.

> 我一直在说「_弄清楚的越多，无知的边界就越长_」。我知道的越多，我就越知道我无知。了解自己的无知是学习的最好动力，我知道的越多，无知就越痛苦。遗忘也是一个原因。当我意识到即使是一个小学生也知道我不知道的事情时，我一直很生气。即使是 5 岁的孩子也能问出更好的问题。我认为，只要我保持扎实的心智能力，我的学习热情就会一直保持下去。

> As for food tastes, I am not sure how much of that is really programmed into the brain, and how much comes from the same mechanism as knowledge in a conservative brain. After the collapse of the Berlin Wall, I had my first ever chance to taste mussels. I was 28. That's the age when we are supposed to have lost our ability to expand our taste range. When taking in my first nibble, I was pretty sure I would vomit. It felt like torture. I could say to myself a dozen times "_this is just healthy food, many people enjoy it, use your reason, why get emotional..._", it did not help much. I managed to swallow a few pieces and was relieved when my portion was over. However, I did not give up. I tried again. I tried to fit my optimum [push zone](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Push_zone) that got very narrow. If I tried too hard or too early, I would hate mussels for life. If I tried too late, I would have forgotten what I had learned in my first experience. My second take at mussels was a bit more relaxed. I was able to find some nice tastes in there despite suffering a lot. A few months later, I enjoyed mussels as much as anyone introduced to the food at earlier stages. There was no novelty seeking in that experience. However, my tastes have been reshaped. Today, I love mussels. Delicious! Am I really deprived of novelty seeking in the area of foods? Not entirely, I love experimenting with various spices and spice combinations. My friend ate a scorpion in Thailand yesterday, his happy face made me intrigued. If I was in Thailand...

> 至于食物的味道，我不确定其中有多少被真正输入大脑，又有多少来自那类似的机制，就如在一个保守的大脑里的知识一般。柏林墙倒塌后，我第一次有机会品尝贻贝。我 28 岁。在那个年纪，我们应该已经失去了扩大自己口味范围的能力。当我吃第一口时，我非常肯定我会呕吐。感觉像是酷刑。我可以对自己说十几次「*这只是健康的食物，很多人喜欢它，用你的理智，为什么要变得情绪化…*」，这没有多大帮助。我好不容易吞下了几口，吃完后才松了一口气。然而，我没有放弃。我又试了一次。我试图去适应我的最佳[推动区](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Push_zone)，这个推动区变得非常窄。如果我太努力或太早尝试，我将终生憎恨贻贝。如果我尝试得太晚了，我就会忘记我在第一次经历中学到的东西。我第二次吃贻贝时稍微放松了一点。尽管经历了很多痛苦，我还是在那里发现了一些美味。几个月后，我和那些在早期接触到贻贝的人一样喜欢贻贝。那次经历中没有什么新奇的东西。然而，我的口味已经改变了。今天，我喜欢贻贝。美味！我真的被剥夺了在食物方面寻求新奇的能力吗？不完全是，我喜欢尝试各种香料和香料组合。我的朋友昨天在泰国吃了一只蝎子，他快乐的表情引起了我的兴趣。如果我在泰国...

> As a student, I tried out dozens of programming languages. The more exotic the language the greater the fascination. SuperMemo was developed in Pascal in 1987. Since then I settled on Pascal and stopped my explorations. A **cynic** would attribute that to aging. My interpretation is different. I use the tool that works best for me. I reserve my exploration time for other things. I do not explore less. I explore differently. My [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) in the area of programming languages has been satisfied, however, my overall learn drive is still pretty hungry.

> 作为一名学生，我尝试了几十种编程语言。语言越有异国情调，就越有魅力。SuperMemo 是在 1987 年用 Pascal 开发的。从那以后，我固定在 Pascal 并停止了我的探究。**犬儒学派**的人会把这归因于衰老。我的解释不同。我使用最适合我的工具。我把我的探究时间留给了其他事情。我没有减少探究。我探究不同的方向。我在编程语言领域的学习内驱力已经得到了满足，但是我的整体学习内驱力仍然很饥渴。

> Like an immature student, I also got bored with spaced repetition and memory saying "_there is not much to learn or discover in the field_". My colleagues, esp. Krzysztof Biedalak and Janusz Murakowski, gave me a tiny corrector push saying "_The [two-variable model of memory](http://www.super-memory.com/english/2vm.htm) could make the algorithm simpler and easier to implement, license, and promote_". Once I started exploring the dried up area, I have discovered a million things I did not know, and re-ignited my passion for spaced repetition. Ironically, the algorithm did not get that much simpler, but the truth is that dead passions can be re-awakened.

> 像一个不成熟的学生一样，我也厌倦过间隔重复和记忆，说「_在这个领域没有什么可学习或发现的_」。我的同事，尤其是 Krzysztof Biedalak 和 Janusz Murakowski ，给了我一个小小的校正推送，说「[_双变量记忆模型_](http://www.super-memory.com/english/2vm.htm)_可以使算法更简单，更容易实现、许可和推广_」。当我开始探索这个干涸的领域，我就发现了无数我不知道的东西，并重新点燃了我对间隔重复的热情。讽刺的是，这个算法并没有变得那么简单，但事实是，熄灭的激情可以被重新点燃。

### 5.8 Perpetual learn drive

### 永恒的学习内驱力

Passions come and wane. This process is controllable. [Self-directed learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-directed_learning) is the best expression of that control. Spaced repetition helps retain gains from waning passions. This, in turn, helps passion re-awakening in need.

激情来来去去。这个过程是可控的。[自我导向学习](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-directed_learning)是这种控制的最佳表现。间隔重复有助于从逐渐消退的激情中保持收益。反过来，这又有助于激情在需要时重新点燃。

> **Love of learning can be suppressed quite effectively, and then it can also be restored and revived**
>
> **对学习的热爱可以被很有效的抑制，然而它也可以被恢复和再生**

The process of building up enthusiasm for learning is easily trainable and easily suppressed. There is a strong neural component. Damage done by bad schooling is reversible, and one can go well above his or her original baseline. Some of the original potential, however, may be lost for ever.

培养学习热情的过程很容易训练，也很容易被抑制。在这有很强的与神经系统有关的成分。糟糕的教育造成的损害是可逆的，一个人可以远远超过他或她最初的基线。然而，一些最初的潜力可能永远失去。

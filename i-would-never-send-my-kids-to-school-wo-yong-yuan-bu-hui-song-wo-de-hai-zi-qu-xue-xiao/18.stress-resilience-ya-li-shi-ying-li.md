### 18.1 Good stress and bad stress

### 有益压力与有害压力

While scientists speak of the damaging effects of stress on the brain, the concept of stress-free upbringing receives a great deal of scorn in social media. The confusion comes from the failure to differentiate between various forms of stress.

虽然科学家们大都认为压力对大脑具有破坏性影响，但无压力教育的概念在社交媒体中同样受到极大的质疑。混淆来自于人们未能正确区分各种形式的压力。

Kids who suffer from separation anxiety when dropped in daycare at the very young age provide an example of highly harmful stress. On the other hand, injuries suffered in the football field may be taken as a badge of honor, and an example of good stress that builds resilience. Bad stress will result in loss of brain cells, while good stress may, in theory, have the opposite effect.

儿童若在很小的时候就被送到托儿所，将会使他们更加容易产生与父母分离的焦虑症状，这就是高度有害压力的一个例子。而另一方面，在足球场上受伤则更像是一种荣誉的象征，这是良好的压力提升压力适应力的一个例子。坏的压力会导致脑细胞的损失，而好的压力，在理论上，极可能有相反的效果。

[Attachment parenting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_parenting) is often derided as "stress-free upbringing", while it should rather be seen as a good parenting that indeed helps prevent stress wherever it is harmful for health or brain development.

让儿童一直呆在父母身边的[依恋养育](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_parenting)经常被嘲笑为「无压力的抚养」，而它应该被视为一种良好的养育方式，因为这种方式确实有助于预防对健康或大脑发育的有害影响。

### 18.2 Global loss of IQ

### 全球性智商下降

[Flynn effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect) says that there is a global increase in IQ from generation to generation. However, there is also a dark force in action that counteracts that positive trend. There is a global loss of brain cells and a global loss of creative power in developed societies. This loss is caused by bad sleep, stress, and depression. We have unleashed forces that keep destroying brains in modern society, and those forces seem to only increase in power from decade to decade. We can counteract those forces by using the tools of neuroscience. We need to start from shielding babies, toddlers, kids, and adolescents from brain-altering influences that shape their future life and leave them defenseless in face of adversity. The younger the child, the more important it is to take the right approach. Mishandling young brain leaves permanent imprints on personality and brain health that may be hard to correct in adulthood.

[Flynn 效应](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect)表明智商在世代增长。然而，还有一种不明朗的力量在抵消这种积极的趋势。据调查，在发达国家，普通人的脑细胞正在代代丧失，创造力也在代代丧失。这种损失是由睡眠不好，有害压力和抑郁引起的。在现代社会，我们已经不断地将某些能够摧毁大脑的力量解放了出来，而这些力量似乎只会在十年又十年的时间里不断增强。但我们可以利用神经科学的知识来抵消这些力量。我们需要从保护婴儿，学步儿童，儿童和青少年开始，避免他们未来生活的改变对大脑的负面影响，这种负面影响让他们在逆境中毫无防备。孩子越小，采取正确方法就越重要。对年轻大脑的照顾欠佳会在人格和大脑健康上留下永久性印记，这在成年后可能很难纠正。

The very first step is the need to **clear up the fog surrounding the myth that exposing kids to stress early will make them more stress resistant later in life**. There is only a tiny grain of truth in that claim, which otherwise is seriously harmful.

第一步是需要消除**早期让孩子接触压力会使他们在以后的生活中更能抵抗压力这一错误观念**。这种观念中只有一小部分是正确的，这样做只会对孩子造成严重的危害。

### 18.3 Resistance to chronic stress

### 抵抗慢性压力

From the proponents of rigors of daycare and schooling, I hear it over and over again: "*How will the kid cope as an adult?*" "*Will he tell the boss 'I like to sleep long and work 2 hours only?*'".

从幼儿园和学校严谨的支持者那里，我一遍又一遍地听到：「*孩子们将如何在未来以成年人的姿态应对生活的麻烦？*」 「*难道还指望他会告诉老板『我可喜欢睡觉啦，我一天只工作两个小时呢！』*」。

[Peter Gray](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Peter_Gray) put it mildly by saying "*some people believe*" in the supposed myth: "*the very unpleasantness of school is good for children, so they will learn to tolerate unpleasantness as preparation for real life*". Gray's soft claim probably comes from the fact that he comes from the culture where homeschooling is exploding. In Europe, the myth of "*trainability of chronic stress resistance*" in children is omnipresent.

[Peter Gray](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Peter_Gray) 温和地说：「*有些人相信*」所谓的『传闻』——「*在学校中的不愉快对孩子们有好处，这样他们会学会容忍不愉快作为现实生活的准备*」。Gray 的温和声明可能正是因为他所处的文化环境中「家庭学校」的愈发流行。在欧洲，对儿童的「*慢性压力抵抗训练*」的错误观念无处不在。

The reasoning carries a vicious prescription: expose kids to stress to get them ready for adulthood! [Alfie Kohn](http://www.alfiekohn.org/) mocks it: *Punch the kid today because someone might punch her in the future*.

这个推理带来了一个恶毒的解决办法：那就是让孩子们承受压力！让他们为成年做好准备！[Alfie Kohn](http://www.alfiekohn.org/) 嘲笑它：*难道因为孩子将来会被别人欺负，所以我今天就要打孩子吗？*

The myth of trainable resilience is not only the domain of the backward, ignorant, and uneducated. It originates from some research on rats in the 1950s. It permeates well-educated and open-minded families. Amazingly, I hear that even from high-IQ teachers. It all comes from a painful ignorance or misunderstanding of neuroscience. The pernicious myth of beneficial exposure to stress needs to be combated vigorously. It hurts kids around the world, all the time. The thinking goes like this: if muscle stress makes it stronger, if bone stress make it harder, if brain effort makes it smarter, then early waking makes the kid resistant to early waking stress, or maternal separation makes the kid resistant to adversities of life, etc.

因为 20 世纪 50 年代一些对老鼠的研究，抗压能力是可训练的这一错误观念不仅备受那些落后，无知和未受过教育的人信赖，同时也渗透到受过良好教育和思想开放的家庭。更令人惊讶的是，我甚至从高智商的教师那里听到了这种说法。这一切都源于对神经科学的极度误解和无知。压力带来好处这一有害的传言需要大力打击。它每时每刻都在伤害世界各地的孩子。这种想法就像：如果肌肉压力使它变得更强壮，如果骨骼压力使它变得更坚硬，如果大脑的努力使它变得更聪明，那么早起就会使孩子抵抗早起的压力？或者母亲的分离的痛苦就会使孩子抵抗生活中的逆境吗？等等。

The problem is that not all tissues and systems are trainable, and not all degrees of stress bring improvement. It is hard to break natural barriers in height or vision with training. You cannot exercise your teeth to crush diamond or adapt your brain to banging the head against the wall. Excess stress will tear muscles and break the bones. If resistance to [chronic stress](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Chronic_stress) was trainable, we would have [Romanian orphans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_orphans) taking leadership in NASA, or winning in Formula One.

问题是并非所有组织和系统都是可训练的，并且并非所有程度的压力都会带来改善。通过训练很难打破身高或视力的天然限制。你不能锻炼牙齿来压碎钻石或让你的大脑适应将头撞到墙上的冲击。过度的压力会撕裂肌肉并打破骨骼。如果对[慢性压力](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Chronic_stress)的抵抗力是可训练的，我们就会让[罗马尼亚孤儿](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_orphans)在 NASA 中担任领导，或者在一级方程式赛车中获胜。

### 18.4 Adaptation to stress

### 适应压力

When a fighter is to face an opponent in the ring, his body activates a stress response. Fighting is stressful. Stress response helps to fight better. Having spent many hours in the ring, fighters understand risks and dangers better. They know how to avoid punches. Stress level in good fighters is reduced. This is **knowledge-based adaptation to stress**. With experience, fighters understand the game of fighting better. In boxing, top-level competitors may drive this knowledge-based adaptation to the point of actually enjoying the prospect of a risky encounter.

当拳击手在拳击场上面对对手时，他的身体会产生压力反应。斗争是压力来源。压力反应有助于更好地战斗。在拳击场上打了好几个小时之后，拳手们对风险和危险有了更好的理解。他们知道如何避免挨打。优秀拳击手的压力水平会降低。这是**基于知识的压力适应**。有了经验，拳击手们就能更好地理解拳击比赛。在拳击比赛中，顶级选手可能会将这种基于知识的适应能力提升到实际战斗中，从而享受拳击场上的邂逅。

There are many ways we can adapt to stress using good practise, habits or procedures. For example, I advocate an approach in which the last 2-4 hours of the waking day are protected from stress. This is the time when the phone should be off and the employee should be protected from the employer (if his particular profession permits such an arrangement). This is the time when reading e-mail should be prohibited. This is the time when job-related investigations should be closed. Surfing on the net should be limited to unexciting or pleasurable areas of interest. Even then it may negatively affect the circadian cycle due to the exposure to blue light.

我们有很多方法可以通过良好的实践，习惯或程序来适应压力。例如，我提倡一种方式，在醒着的最后 2 - 4 个小时免受压力。这段时间应该关掉电话，员工应该远离雇主（如果他的职业允许这样做的话）。这段时间应该禁止阅读电子邮件。这时应该结束与工作有关的调查或安排。上网应该限制在不令人兴奋或愉快的兴趣领域。即便如此，由于暴露在蓝光下，它也会对昼夜周期产生负面影响。

The stress that should be avoided in the evening, when experienced at mid-day, may have a beneficial impact on the mind and intellectual performance. We would call it [eustress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustress). When timed differently, e.g. before sleep, the stress response may be exaggerated, harmful, or interfere with good sleep. When good habits help avoid or cope with stress, I call it **procedural adaptation to stress**.

在晚上应该避免的压力，当在中午经历时，可能对大脑和智力表现更加有益。我们称之为[良性压力](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustress)。如果时间不同，例如在睡眠前，压力反应可能被身体放大，有害或干扰良好的睡眠。当良好的习惯有助于避免或应对压力时，我称之为**压力的程序性适应**。

Locke and Rousseau have long understood that exposing a kid to a stress of "*season, climates, elements*" is a good thing. This is not adaptation to stress, it is **physiological adaptation** to environmental stressors. Winter swimming might be stressful, and exposure will result in knowledge-based and procedural adaptations. However, there is also a vital physiological component where physiological adaptation to cold exposure takes away the edge from the stressor.

Locke 和 Rousseau 早就明白，让孩子面对「*季节，气候，元素*」的压力是一件好事。这不是对压力的适应，而是对环境压力的**生理适应**。冬季游泳可能会带来压力，暴露在水中会使孩子习得基本常识和压力的程序性适应。然而，这一适应过程还有一个重要的生理组成部分，即对寒冷环境的生理适应消除了应激源的有害影响。

Last but not least there is attenuation and learned helplessness. We can adapt to stress by making the brain stop responding to the stressor. Metaphorically speaking, we can damage and silence portions of the brain. Let's call it: **adaptation via injury**. This is what happens in animals deprived of freedom. This also happens in kids whose freedom is taken away by coercive schooling. At some point, coerced learning is no longer stressful. Children become numb and disinterested.

最后同样重要的是，自我逃避和习得性无助。我们可以通过让大脑停止对压力源做出反应来适应压力。比喻说，我们可以损伤大脑的某些部分并使其沉默。我们称之为：**通过伤害适应**。这就是被剥夺自由的动物所发生的事情。这种情况也发生在自由被强制性教育剥夺的孩子身上。在某些时候，强迫学习不再有压力。孩子们变得麻木不仁。

We are all aware of those coping mechanisms. This is why many parents easily fall victim to the belief that exposure to stress is a good preparation for adult life. We can easily get misled by inaccurate hints on **authoritarian parenting**. Williams sisters, Serena and Venus, accomplished the impossible with a seemingly authoritarian father. However, few people notice that this training had actually been guided by talents within. A seemingly strict father can actually capitalize on natural inner drives of kids who propel themselves to excellence with a degree of rigid guidance well-enclosed or approaching the optimum [push zone](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Push_zone). In a similar manner, Laszlo Polgar made his daughters spend inordinate hours over chess. He drove them to the top of the world in chess rankings. It is underestimated that kids must actually learn to love chess in the first place. Such a love and passion are the key to success.

我们都知道这些应对机制。这就是为什么许多父母很容易成为这种观念的受害者，他们认为压力是为成年生活做好准备的良好条件。我们很容易被**育儿权威**的不准确暗示误导。Williams 姐妹，Serena 和 Venus，在一个看似独裁的父亲教育下完成了令人惊叹的成就。然而，很少有人注意到这种训练实际上是由内在的天赋引导的。一个看似严格的父亲实际上可以充分利用孩子们的自然内在动力，他们通过一定程度的严格指导将自己推向卓越，或者接近最佳[推动区](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Push_zone)。以类似的方式，Laszlo Polgar 让他的女儿们在国际象棋上花了大量的时间。在国际象棋排名中将她们带到了世界之巅。孩子们必须首先学会热爱象棋，这一点被低估了。这样的爱和激情才是成功的关键。

Many a parent may be tempted to emulate Williams or Polgar accomplishments in total oblivion of the primary rule: **kids should never be exposed to chronic stress**. Their brains are too young. Their minds are too immature. They cannot effectively employ knowledge-based or procedural adaptation to stress. Instead, they will adapt via [learned helplessness](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learned_helplessness) and their brain growth will be stunted.

许多父母可能会试图效仿Williams或Polgar的成就，却完全遗忘了一条基本准则：**孩子们永远不应该长期处于慢性压力下**。他们的大脑太年轻了。他们的思想太不成熟了。他们无法有效地利用基于知识或程序的压力来适应压力。相反，他们将通过[习得性无助](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learned_helplessness)来适应，他们的大脑发育将受到阻碍。

There are benefits to eustress, and various forms of "stress" are part of a healthy training and development. However, there are no trainable defences against chronic stress, i.e. the one you get with perpetual sleep deprivation, bullying, maternal separation, child abuse, etc. Those are stresses that change the metabolism, and change the wiring of the brain. They correlate well with an increase in mental disease, behavioral disorders, addictions, etc. Chronic stress is the type of stress you go to sleep with. Characterically, this is the stress that does not go away on waking. Its chronic nature is best expressed by the fact that there is no "*rise and shine*". Chronically stressed kid wakes up with a worry. Chronic stress can persist and gnaw at you for days or weeks. Attenuation can be used to reduce the impact of inevitable stress. Professional training helps stress management in stressful jobs. However, the purpose of those is the prevention of chronic stress, procedural adaptation, or knowledge-based adaptation. Professional training does not provide biological resistance to the effects of chronic stress.

良性压力有好处，各种形式的「压力」是健康训练和发展的一部分。然而，对于长期的压力，如长期睡眠不足、恃强凌弱、父母分居、虐待儿童等，没有可训练的防御措施。这些压力会改变新陈代谢，改变大脑的线路。它们与精神疾病，行为障碍，成瘾等的增加密切相关。慢性压力是你睡觉时的压力类型。特点是，这种压力不会在醒来时消失。它的长期性集中表现在个人没有「*成就与光彩*」。长期压力大的孩子一觉醒来仍然忧心忡忡。慢性压力的折磨可以持续存在几天或几周。自我逃避可用于减少不可避免的压力影响。专业培训有助于在压力工作中进行压力管理。然而，这些目的是预防慢性压力，程序适应或基于知识的适应。在慢性压力的影响下，专业培训不能提高个体生理上的抵抗能力。

### 18.5 Preparation for adulthood

### 为成年做准备

#### 18.5.1 Stress resilience training

#### 压力适应训练

Older psychologists and educators have often been biased by years of analysis of institutionalized children. As a result, they may perpetuate the myth born in the 1950s: "*sour faces in kids are ok because duty and discipline are educational*"! They believe that a well-organized kindergarten group is better than a rowdy sports field crowd of mixed-aged peers. That thinking is directed at preparing the kids to live in the modern adult world.

早一辈的心理学家和教育工作者往往会因为多年来对儿童制度化的分析而产生偏见。因此，他们可能会延续 20 世纪 50 年代得出的荒诞说法：「*孩子们不开心没什么大不了的，因为责任和纪律是有教育意义的！*」他们认为，一个组织良好的幼儿园团体比一群吵吵闹闹的混合年龄段的同龄人要好。这种想法是为了让孩子们为生活在现代成年人世界做好准备。

The opposite is true. Freedom is a better way to shape a better future character. We teach kids to tolerate the reality, while they should rather let their reason figure out what is tolerable and what is welcome in proportion to brain development. Why tolerate toilet, sleep, meal, or sport timing restrictions in violation of the [circadian cycle](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Good_sleep)? Why tolerate departures from the [natural creativity cycle](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Natural_creativity_cycle)? It is smarter to be intolerant and learn to adapt in proportion to brain power and one's own intolerance! Let's adapt the world to humans, not the other way around. Children can be a great factor of change in that respect.

而事实正好相反。自由是塑造更美好未来品格的更好方式。我们教孩子们容忍现实，而他们更应该让他们的理性来决定什么是可以容忍的，什么是受欢迎的，与大脑发育成正比。为什么要忍受解手、睡眠、吃饭或运动的时间限制而违背[生理周期](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Good_sleep)呢?为什么要容忍与[自然创造周期](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Natural_creativity_cycle)的背离?更聪明的做法是不容忍，并学会适应大脑的能力和自己的不容忍!让世界适应人类，而不是反过来。在这方面，儿童可以成为改变的重要因素。

**Youth should be devoted to brain development**. There is no stronger weapon than a well-developed brain. Learning and "preparation" come easy to a brisk brain. They can proceed in proportion to maturity. They can capitalize on the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) with minimal assistance from [optimum push](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Push_zone).

**青年应该致力于大脑的发展**。没有比发达的大脑更强大的武器了。学习和「计划」对一个活跃的大脑来说很容易。它们可以一点一点地让大脑成熟起来。他们可以利用[学习内驱力](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive)，而几乎不需要最佳[推动区](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Push_zone)的帮助。。

#### 18.5.2 Discipline training

#### 纪律训练

Preparation for adulthood is not only about stress resilience. Many educators claim that kids who suffer no discipline won't be able to adapt to a job that requires a submission. This is false. All animals follow an instinctive drive for freedom. This drive has evolutionary benefits. Captured deer will struggle to the point of injury. Restrained puppy will yelp for freedom of space. Human mind that grows free from shackles will retain the quest for open spaces and freedom till the very end of life. For a healthy brain, there is very little difficulty in achieving self-restraint and self-discipline through reason. Limits on freedom in childhood may generate stress that may limit brain development that, later in life, paradoxically, will make it harder to impose self-discipline. On the other side of the equation, freedom fosters creativity, which is an equally priced possession. You do not need to be an employer to know that it is far easier for a creative individual to self-impose restraint than for a well-disciplined soldier to [become creative on demand](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Creativity:_abundant_but_suppressed!). Preparation for adulthood needs to take into account the immaturity of the brain. Taking on a hard 9-5 job may be easy for a high-IQ thirty-year-old. The same job may be highly stressful for a teen, bad for health for a 10-year-old, or a plain brain destroyer for a 5-year-old. We should celebrate the fact that we no longer need to send 8 year olds to handle a factory assembly line to earn a living.

为成年做准备不仅仅是为了应对压力。许多教育工作者声称，没有纪律的孩子将无法适应将来的工作。这么说是错误的。所有的动物都本能地追求自由。这种驱动力具有进化上的好处。被捕获的鹿会挣扎到受伤的程度。被约束的小狗会为自由的空间狂吠。从枷锁中解放出来的人之心灵，将会保留对开放空间和自由的追求，直到生命的尽头。对于一个健康的大脑来说，通过理性来实现自我约束和自律是非常容易的。童年时期对自由的限制可能会产生压力，这可能会限制大脑的发育，而在以后的生活中，矛盾的是，这将使自律变得更加困难。在等式的一边，自由促进创造力，而创造力是一种同等价值的财产。你不需要成为一名雇主就能知道，一个有创造力的人自我约束要比一个纪律严明的士兵[根据需要变得有创造力](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Creativity:_abundant_but_suppressed!)容易得多。为成年做准备需要考虑到大脑的不成熟。对于一个高智商的 30 岁的人来说，从事朝九晚五的工作可能很容易。同样的工作对一个十几岁的孩子来说可能是非常有压力的，对一个 10 岁的孩子来说可能是有害健康的，或者对一个 5 岁的孩子来说可能是一个完全的大脑破坏。我们应该庆祝这样一个事实，我们不再需要送8岁的孩子去工厂流水线上工作来为我们自己谋生。

### 18.6 Homeschooler's sleep

### 家庭教育生的睡眠情况

Homeschoolers often boast that what they like most about learning at home is that they can get good sleep. **The right to get good sleep should be a basic human right for children**. Some professions involve inevitable sleep deprivation or interference with chronobiology. However, adaptations to "messy sleep" lifestyle are predominantly procedural, not biological. Going to sleep early, and sticking to regular sleep hours are both procedural adaptations. The only significant biological adaptation is the possibility of determining the sleep phase via [chronotherapy](http://super-memory.com/articles/sleep.htm#Curing_DSPS_and_insomnia). In the course of 2-3 weeks, an owl can be made into an early bird with the tools of chronobiology. This is again procedural adaptation that capitalizes on a single property of the sleep control system: [sleep phase](http://super-memory.com/articles/sleep.htm#Curing_DSPS_and_insomnia). This is not a biological adaptation that helps reduce the effects of sleep deprivation once it occurs.

在家上学的孩子经常自豪说，他们最喜欢在家学习的原因是他们可以睡个好觉。**获得良好睡眠的权利应该是儿童的一项基本人权**。有些职业不可避免地会导致睡眠不足或生物钟紊乱。然而，适应「凌乱的睡眠」生活方式主要是程序性的，而不是天生的。早睡和坚持规律的睡眠时间都是后天规范的适应。唯一重要的生物适应是通过[时间调整](http://super-memory.com/articles/sleep.htm#Curing_DSPS_and_insomnia)决定可能的睡眠阶段。在2-3周的过程中，夜猫子可以用[时间生物学](http://super-memory.com/articles/sleep.htm#Curing_DSPS_and_insomnia)的方式变成一只早起的鸟。这又是一种程序化的适应，利用了睡眠控制系统的一个单一属性: [睡眠阶段](http://super-memory.com/articles/sleep.htm#Curing_DSPS_and_insomnia)。但是当睡眠剥夺一旦发生，这并不是一种有助于减少压力影响的生物适应。

Torturing kids with an alarm clock to train school discipline is as bad as feeding them with alcohol. Both affect brain structures and permanently change lives. The only difference is that alarm clocks are still socially acceptable.

用闹钟来折磨孩子来训练学校纪律就像让他们酗酒一样糟糕。两者都会影响大脑结构，并永久地改变个人的生活。唯一的区别是，闹钟在社会上仍然是可以接受的。

For contrast, imagine giving a child a 50ml glass of vodka in the morning. In terms of ravages to the brain and personality, this might be an alcohol equivalent of waking the kid up 2 hours before his or her optimum waking time (which might be the case for half the kids). Biologically speaking, the body can mount a degree of resistance to alcohol by streamlining the enzymatic engine needed to metabolise ethanol. In an extreme case, there might be no damage from alcohol. There are virtually no defenses against neural effects of sleep deprivation. Once you incur deprivation, you certainly incur damage.

相比之下，想象一下早上给孩子一杯 50 毫升的伏特加。就对大脑和性格的破坏而言，这可能相当于「酒精」先生在孩子最佳清醒时间的两小时前把他叫醒（这可能是一半孩子的情况）。从生物学上讲，身体可以通过简化代谢乙醇所需的酶引擎，对酒精产生一定程度的抵抗力。在极端的情况下，酒精可能不会造成伤害。事实上，睡眠剥夺对神经系统的影响是无法抵御的。一旦你遭受剥夺，你一定会遭受伤害。

**We should never train kids to resist stress of sleep deprivation by exposure**. Trainability and adaptability are minimal. Damage is real, serious and long-lasting. Sleep deprivation in kids is one of the prime forces counteracting the [global increase in intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect).

**我们永远不应该训练孩子们通过这种方式来抵抗睡眠不足的压力**。可训练性和适应性是最小的。损害是真实的、严重的和长期的。儿童睡眠不足是阻碍[全球智力增长](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect)的主要因素之一。

### 18.7 Optimum stress exposure

### 最佳压力接触

Stress can be acute, i.e. sudden. It can also be chronic, i.e. long lasting. It is the [chronic stress than does most of the damage](http://www.humanstress.ca/stress/understand-your-stress/acute-vs-chronic-stress.html).

压力可能是急性的，即突然的。它也可以是慢性的，即持久的。而[慢性压力比大多数压力伤害都要严重](http://www.humanstress.ca/stress/understand-your-stress/acute-vs-chronic-stress.html)。

The formula for optimum stress exposure in development is pretty simple. **Kids should never be exposed to chronic stress**. [Eustress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustress) is welcome, esp. as a motivator. Acute stress can be employed only when there are demonstrable effects of known benefits. The underlying idea is that chronic stress is a brain destroyer. Via hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, chronic stress leads to restrictions on neurogenesis, brain growth and development. Even though [stress can improve learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_acceleration_via_stress), the benefits are short-term, and long-term outcomes are negative.

研究过程中最佳承受压力公式相当简单。孩子们不应该长期承受压力。 [良性压力](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustress)是受欢迎的，尤其是作为一个激励因素。急性应激只有在已知益处有明显效果时才能使用。潜在的观点是，长期的压力是大脑的破坏者。慢性应激通过下丘脑-垂体-肾上腺轴，导致神经生长、大脑生长发育受到限制。尽管[压力可以提高学习](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_acceleration_via_stress)，但好处是短期的，长期的结果是负面的。

The approach of stress shielding should be extended beyond puberty or perhaps even further. Not only is the brain still developing fast, at puberty, hormonal hurricanes blow through the young body. Stress in childhood and in adolescence is associated with changes in the brain structure and the development of mental disorders later in life.

压力屏蔽的方法应该延伸到青春期以后，甚至更远。在青春期，不仅大脑仍在快速发育，荷尔蒙飓风还会吹过年轻的身体。童年和青少年时期的压力与大脑结构的变化以及晚年精神障碍的发展有一定的关系。

Only fully formed brain is equipped with tools for declarative and procedural training that may help one [cope with stress](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/I_would_never_send_my_kids_to_school#Adaptation_to_stress). By procedural training, I mean rational choice of procedures that help cope with stress as opposed to natural neurohormonal responses to chronic stress that are always detrimental. An example of stress-combating procedure is the skill to compress stressful stimuli into selected windows in the [natural creativity cycle](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Natural_creativity_cycle), e.g. to precede or coincide with exercise, while protecting sensitive windows in the cycle, e.g. creativity windows, or the time before sleep when all stressors should be avoided, if possible, for the sake of uninterrupted well-timed healthy sleep. An adult can easily organize his day and employ such a circadian procedure to minimize the negative effects of stress. A child may find it difficult. Moreover, all exposure to stress affects brain development. In case of chronic stress, that effect is invariably negative.

只有完全成形的大脑才具备进行陈述性和程序性训练的工具，这些训练可以帮助人们应对压力。我所说的程序训练，指的是理性地选择有助于[应对压力的方式](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/I_would_never_send_my_kids_to_school#Adaptation_to_stress)，而不是神经激素对慢性压力的自然反应。与压力斗争的一个例子是在[自然创造力周期](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Natural_creativity_cycle)中将压力刺激压缩到特定场景中的能力,例如，创造性的场景，或睡觉前的时间，如果可能的话，应该避免所有的压力因素，以便拥有不间断的健康睡眠。一个成年人可以很容易地安排他的一天，并采用这样的昼夜节律程序来最小化压力的负面影响。孩子可能会觉得很难。此外，所有的压力都会影响大脑发育。对于慢性压力，这种影响总是消极的。

Major stressors may be unavoidable. Death of a parent is one of the worst stressors a child can face. This may be a matter of chance. However, most parents in modern world expose kids to chronic stress that can be avoided. Daycare is a prime example. Early weaning is another. Separating a child from her mom for the night, or waking kids early are also frequently exercised.

主要的压力源可能是不可避免的。父母的死亡是孩子可能面临的最严重的压力之一。这可能是偶然的。然而，现代世界的大多数父母都会让孩子面临可以避免的慢性压力。幼儿园是一个很好的例子。早期断奶是另一种。将孩子与母亲分开过夜或早早叫醒孩子也经常被用来锻炼孩子的抗压能力。

In addition to negative impact of stress hormones on the brain, there is a problem of epigenetic control of brain growth in response to environmental stressors. In short, the brain uses genetic machinery to get ready for the evil and dangerous world as reflected by child's environment or her perception thereof. A child raised in an unquestionably loving atmosphere is likely to develop all the neural weaponry needed to deal with stress on declarative and procedural platforms. On the other hand, child exposed to a major trauma or chronic stress will develop a brain with a different neurohormonal profile that is more likely to enhance neurotic aspects of his personality, increase chances of depression, reduce cortisol receptors in the hypothalamus and the hippocampus, remove CRH and ACTH release breaks, provide for the cortisol-oriented dominance of the HPA axis (hyperactive stress system), stunt neurogenesis, affect synaptic pruning, lower hippocampal volume, result in weaker hippocampal control, and so on.

除了应激激素对大脑的负面影响之外，还有一个表观遗传控制的问题，即对环境应激源的大脑生长作出反应。简而言之，大脑使用遗传机制为儿童所处环境或对环境的感知所反映的邪恶和危险世界做好准备。在毫无疑问的爱心氛围中长大的孩子可能会开发出处理陈述性和程序性平台压力所需的所有神经武器。另一方面，暴露于严重创伤或慢性压力的儿童会发展出一种具有不同神经激素特征的大脑，这种大脑更有可能增强其个性，增加抑郁的机会，减少下丘脑和海马体中的皮质醇受体，去除 CRH 和 ACTH 断裂释放，提供 HPA 轴的皮质醇定向优势（过度活跃的应激系统），阻碍神经传递的发生，影响突触修剪，降低海马体体积，导致的海马体控制较弱，等等。

The inevitable exposure to significant stress should be phased in gradually in adulthood when the brain is fully formed.

当大脑完全成型时，不可避免的暴露于显着的压力应该在成年期逐步分阶段进行。

Paradoxically, mixing up stress with love and shelter may be dangerous as well. The kid exposed to the stress of bullying may deepen the injury by ruminating his predicament in the confines of a loving home. This is why parents should also learn about the art of [stress inoculation](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/I_would_never_send_my_kids_to_school#Stress_resilience), which has nothing to do with chronic stress.

矛盾的是，将压力与爱情和庇护混合起来也可能是危险的。受到欺凌压力的孩子可能会在充满爱的家庭里反复思考自己的困境，从而加深伤害。这就是为什么父母也应该了解[压力转移](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/I_would_never_send_my_kids_to_school#Stress_resilience)的形式，这与慢性压力无关。

### 18.8 Stress resilience

### 压力恢复力

If optimum stress exposure implies avoiding [chronic stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_stress) in childhood, how come some behavioral research in animals indicate that stress may improve resilience? For example, intermittent maternal separation may lead to more independent and emotionally sturdy animals? See: [Stress inoculation may improve resilience later in life](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stress_inoculation_may_improve_resilience_later_in_life)

如果最佳的压力承受意味着避免儿童期的[慢性压力](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_stress)，为什么一些动物的行为研究表明压力可以提高适应力?例如，间歇性的母亲分离可能导致更独立和情绪更坚强的动物？请参阅：[压力转移可以改善日后生活对压力的适应力](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stress_inoculation_may_improve_resilience_later_in_life)

The emphasis must then again go on the "chronic" aspect of chronic stress. Some forms of stress are good. They help learning. Locke and Rousseau spoke of hardening. [Psychology literature uses terms such as inoculating or toughening](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Chronic,_acute_and_intermittent_stress_exposure). In many circumstances stress is good for learning, development, and mental health. It can indeed lead to improved stress resilience.

然后，重点必须再次放在慢性压力的「慢性」方面。某些形式的压力是好的。它们帮助学习。Locke 和 Rousseau 谈到了强化。[心理学文献使用诸如接种或增韧之类的术语](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Chronic,_acute_and_intermittent_stress_exposure)。在许多情况下，压力有利于学习，发展和心理健康。它确实可以改善压力适应力。

Maternal separation has negative connotations, but we do not aim at making kids dependent on their mom until teen years. Separation is actually a goal of upbringing. In other words, it needs to proceed. It only needs to proceed incrementally and with respect to biological rhythms. The younger the kid, the greater the effect of separation. It should be avoided at times of sleep, or at nursing (before weaning). It should be avoided at times of crisis, incl. daily circadian drop in stress resilience, e.g. before sleep. Other than that, separation and exposure to acute stress can do wonders to healthy development, incl. emotional development. The best formula for incremental separation: let the kid decide!

孩子离开母亲有负面的影响，但我们的目标不是让孩子在青少年时期依赖母亲。分离实际上是成长的目标。换句话说，它需要继续下去。它只需要按照生物节律循序渐进地进行。孩子越小，分离的影响越大。在睡觉时或哺乳时（断奶前）应该避免分离。在有危险时应该避免，包括，压力恢复的每日昼夜节律下降，例如睡觉前。除此之外，分离和暴露于应激压力可以创造健康的发展，包括情感的发展产生神奇的作用。渐进分离的最佳公式:让孩子自己决定!

Is it then a good idea to throw a kid out of a boat in the middle of a lake to teach him how to swim?

那么把一个孩子从湖中间的船上扔下水教他如何游泳是一个好主意吗？

I keep emphasizing the role of love in family and the need to protect kids from chronic stress. Should this not then be an outrageous and cruel idea?

我一直强调爱在家庭中的作用以及保护孩子免受慢性压力的需要。难道这不是一个令人愤慨和残忍的想法吗？

It actually depends on circumstances. In principle, this is not how effective swimming lessons should be delivered. However, there are many variables that will determine the outcome:

这实际上取决于具体情况。原则上，这不是游泳课程的有效性。但是，有许多变量将决定结果：

- **Child's interpretation**: the best primary indicator is the child's reaction to the event. Is it horror, or perhaps elation? This component is strongly related to personality, disposition, and context
- **儿童的主观理解**：最主要的指标是儿童对事件的反应。是恐怖，还是兴高采烈？这个组成部分与个性，性格和背景密切相关
- **Child's age**: right after birth, kids are pretty well adapted to diving and even surviving on the surface of water on their back. Throwing an untrained adult out of a boat is far less likely to bring anything good. Trying to teach a 50-year-old to swim is close to mission impossible. There are critical period windows in brain growth where stressful stimuli produce different programming effects on brain development, esp. in early childhood
- **孩子的年龄**：出生后，孩子们非常适应潜水，甚至可以在水面上仰面生存。将未经训练的成年人从船上扔出去的适应可能性要小得多。试图教一个50岁的人游泳是不可能完成的任务。在大脑发育的关键时期，压力刺激会对大脑发育产生不同的编程影响，尤其是在幼儿时期。
- **Circadian frame**: a child woken up prematurely in the early morning and thrown into cold water may experience true horror. The same kid at its circadian prime may cope pretty well, and in extreme cases, enjoy the experience
- **昼夜节律**：一个孩子在清晨过早地醒来并被扔进冷水中可能会遇到真正的恐怖。同样的孩子在生理周期的黄金时期可能会应付得很好，在极端的情况下，会享受这种体验。
- **Sense of safety**: it is important who does the throwing. It is a securely attached caregiver (e.g. a loving parent)? Or is it an oppressor (e.g. hated step parent)?
- **安全感**：重要的是谁来传递这种意识。它是一个安全依附的照顾者(例如一个慈爱的父母)?或者是压迫者(比如被憎恨的继父或继母)？

You may wonder why I picked this scary example with a boat. For ethical reasons, scientists would find it hard to execute similar experiments with monkeys, let alone children. We may never get a good scientific verdict on the procedure. However, it so happens that I know two brothers who have been trained using the said method (aged 19 and 13 in 2016). Both brothers are a picture of physical and mental health. Both do ok at school. Both are good swimmers. However, the older brother carries scars of his early training. When I asked him to swim across the pool under water, he hesitated. He admitted that longer periods without breathing under water bring back the horrifying memories from childhood. The younger brother does not have such issues. He actually does not even remember the shock training. Perhaps the variables listed in my analysis above played differently for him. The entire story is based on older brother's recollections. I was not able to take another angle from their radical father. Later in life, he turned to alcohol, abandoned his family, and moved to Germany. I would not be surprised if alcohol played a role in his choice of swimming lesson methodology.

你可能想知道我为什么用船来做这个可怕的例子。出于道德原因，科学家们发现很难用猴子进行类似的实验，更不用说儿童了。我们可能永远不会对这个过程有一个好的科学结论。然而，碰巧我知道有两个兄弟使用过上述方法接受过培训（2016 年为 19 岁和 13 岁）。兄弟俩的身体和精神都很健康。两个都在学校表现良好。他们都是游泳好手。然而，哥哥带着他早期训练的伤疤。当我让他在水下游泳时，他犹豫了。他承认，没有在水下呼吸的较长时间带回了童年时代的可怕记忆。弟弟没有这样的问题。他实际上甚至不记得冲击训练。也许我上面分析中列出的变量对他来说有所不同。整个故事都基于哥哥的回忆。我无法从激进的父亲那里获得他的看法。在那之后，他开始酗酒，抛弃了家庭，搬到了德国。如果酒精对他选择游泳课的方法有影响，我不会感到惊讶。

> Why am I not outraged at this parental attitude? The reason is that my first swimming lessons were in a very similar category. My brother, 16 years senior, was a great early coach and teacher. He would toss me off a 3-5 meter guard tower to deep water in a lake. I was 6 years old and I could not swim. However, the distance I needed to make was just 2-4 meters to the pier. The best part of the experience was the crowd of spectators who cheered a tiny guy taking a plunge from a height. I was a little showoff and for show I was ready to risk my life. If we review the list of factors affecting the outcome of the experience, I seem to have met all conditions for making it fun, positive and effective. I loved the crowd and cheers. I was not too old to be anxious. It was a middle of a hot day, and I trusted my brother as no one else in the world. It was great. After this radical start, I gradually improved my swimming skills to cross many scary lakes and rivers before my teens. Interestingly, later in life, I became more risk averse and lost some of my resilience, mostly through neglect. Last but not least, I was powerfully impacted by the movie "*The Jaws*". By the time I was 17 years old, swimming across a lake or out into sea would always bring back some scenes from the movie.

> 为什么我对这种父母态度不感到愤怒？原因是我的第一次游泳课程属于非常相似的情况。我哥哥比我大16岁，是一位伟大的幼儿早教和老师。他会把我从一个3-5米长的警卫塔扔到湖里的深水里。那时我6岁，我不会游泳。然而，我距离码头只有2-4米。这次经历的最佳部分是一群观众，他们为一个从高处跳下的小个子欢呼。我有点爱炫耀，为了表演我已经准备好冒险了。如果我们回顾一下影响体验结果的因素列表，我似乎已经满足了让它变得有趣、积极和有效的所有条件。我喜欢人群和欢呼。我还没有老到看淡世俗的地步。那是一个大热天，我相信我的兄弟是世界上最可靠的人。太棒了。在这个刺激的开始之后，我逐渐提高了我的游泳技巧，在我十几岁之前就穿过了许多可怕的湖泊和河流。有趣的是，在以后的生活中，我变得更加厌恶风险并且失去了一些韧性，主要是由于忽视。最后，我受到电影「大白鲨」的强烈影响。在我17岁的之后，游泳穿过湖泊或者进入大海总会让我想起电影中的一些场景。

[Peter Gray](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Peter_Gray) advocates trustful parenting. In the present world, it seems awfully hard, but without a degree of risk and hardening, we won't raise a generation of conquerors, astronauts, CEOs or perhaps even Einsteins.

[Peter Gray](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Peter_Gray) 提倡信任教育。在当今世界，它似乎非常艰难，但如果没有一定程度的风险和强化，我们就不会培养一代征服者，宇航员，首席执行官甚至爱因斯坦。

[John Taylor Gatto](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/John_Taylor_Gatto:_I_refuse_to_hurt_children) is even more radical. He claims that [Richard Branson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Branson)'s mother inspired him with the best formula for raising genius. When Branson was four, his mom, with his nod, dropped him off miles from home to find his way back on his own. Branson needed 8 hours. He succeeded and later claimed it was one of the best lessons he got in life. Nothing seemed like an impossible challenge any more.

[John Taylor Gatto](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/John_Taylor_Gatto:_I_refuse_to_hurt_children) 更加激进。他声称，[Richard Branson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Branson) 的母亲用他最好的抚养天才法激励他。当 Branson 四岁的时候，在他的同意下，他妈妈把他从家里甩了出去，找回了自己的路。布兰森用了 8 个小时。他成功了，后来声称这是他生命中最好的课程之一。似乎再也没有什么是不可能战胜的了。

> When I was 12, in summer 1974, my mom agreed I took a bike trip on old Polish communist roads to a city 150 km away (and later back). Today, I recall with horror huge fully-loaded trucks wheezing by. However, this kind of trip indeed leaves some strong imprint on a young mind. I took my best friend Piotr Ruta with me. On arrival to our destination, we slept in a haystack. On the way back, in the night, without lights, we were forced to sleep in a field of wheat in rain because we took a truck on the side of the road for a police car. We got soaked and chilled to the bone. The best part of the trip was the appreciation for the warmth of home and even for a decent meal. However, this trip did not do much to our genius. I was expelled from school a few months later for bad behavior. Ruta did not even bother to go to high school. He got a job in a nearby bakery where he stayed until a day when a tram car accident resulted in amputation of his foot in his early 20s. Perhaps, to benefit better, we should have taken the trip at the age of four?

> 1974 年夏天，当我 12 岁的时候，我妈妈同意我骑自行车沿着旧的波兰共产主义道路去 150 公里外的一个城市（后来又回来了）。今天，我惊恐地回忆起满载货物的大卡车呼啸而过。然而，这种旅行确实给年轻人留下了深刻的印象。我带着我最好的朋友 Piotr Ruta。到达目的地时，我们睡在干草堆里。在回去的路上，在没有灯的夜里，我们被迫在雨中睡在麦田里，因为我们在路边搭了一辆卡车去警车。我们浑身湿透，冻得透不过气来。旅途中最美妙的部分是对家的温暖，甚至对一顿像样的饭的感激之情。然而，这次旅行并没有对我们的天才产生多大影响。几个月后，我因为行为不端被学校开除了。鲁塔甚至懒得上高中。他在附近的一家面包店找到了一份工作，一直待到 20 岁出头的某一天，一场电车车祸导致他的脚被截肢。也许，为了更好地受益，我们应该在四岁的时候就开始旅行?

When tiny babies are thrown into an icehole in Ukraine, the reaction of a western mom is nearly universal: horror. As babies are pretty poor at "*planning ahead*", anticipatory chronic stress is not a factor. Therefore, the ultimate litmus test is the baby's response. If temporary shock is promptly replaced with a wide smile or euphoria, this type of acute stress exposure is likely to do a lot of good, in terms of overall health, brain health, and resilience.

当小小的婴儿被扔进乌克兰的一个冰洞时，西方妈妈的反应几乎是普遍的：恐怖。由于婴儿在「提前计划」方面相当差，预期的慢性压力不是一个因素。因此，最终的试金石是宝宝的反应。如果暂时的休克会立即被一个灿烂的微笑或兴奋所取代，那么这种类型的急性应激暴露在整体健康，大脑健康和恢复力方面可能会有很大的好处。

In summary, **we should surround kids with love, shelter them from chronic stress, and keep the mind open when it comes to acute stress and beneficial stress inoculation**. On the other hand, **childhood without exposure to risk and acute stress is less likely to lead to resilience later in life**.

总之，**我们应该用爱来包围孩子，避免慢性压力，并在急性压力和有益的压力接种时保持心态开放**。另一方面，**没有暴露于风险和急性压力的儿童不太可能在以后的生活中提高恢复力**。

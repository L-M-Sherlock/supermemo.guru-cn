It is pretty tragic to see that many solutions have already been known for centuries, but they keep getting overlooked. I chose the words of [John Locke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke)(1963) as the motto for this text:

看到许多解决方案在几个世纪前就已经为人所知，但却一直被忽视，这是相当可悲的。我选择[约翰·洛克](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke)（John Locke, 1963年）的话作为本书的箴言：

> None of the things they are to learn, should ever be made a burthen to them, or impos'd on them as a task. Whatever is so propos'd, presently becomes irksome; the mind takes an aversion to it, though before it were a thing of delight or indifferency
>
> 儿童应学的事情，决不应该变成儿童的一种负担，也不应当当做一种任务去加在他们身上。否则他们立刻便会讨厌它；哪怕他们以前本来喜爱那件事，或者不爱也不憎，他们对他都会感到厌恶。

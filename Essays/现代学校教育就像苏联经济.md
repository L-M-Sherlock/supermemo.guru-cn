# Modern schooling is like Soviet economy 现代学校教育就像苏联经济

# Schooling and communism

# 学校教育与共产主义

Most people in the industrialized world realize that market economy has many advantages that cannot be replaced with an economy based on micromanaged central control. At the same time, the same people believe in the education based on centrally planned [curriculum](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Curriculum). If we realize that both (1) economies and (2) school systems are subject to similar issues of mathematical optimization, we can resolve this cultural paradox of perception.

工业化世界的大多数人都认识到，市场经济有许多优点，是以微观管理的中央控制为基础的经济所不能取代的。同时，这些人也相信基于中央计划课程的教育。如果我们认识到（1）经济和（2）学校制度都面临着类似的数学优化问题，我们就可以解决这种文化上的认识悖论。

[Compulsory schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling) is very inefficient at educating people. The inefficiency is analogous to problems with command economy

义务教育对人的教育效率非常低。这种低效率类似于命令经济的问题

# Incremental enslavement by propaganda

# 通过宣传逐步实现奴役

As a kid, I was enslaved intellectually. I was a communist. I believed school was good and served my development. I have changed since.

小时候，我在智力上被奴役了。我是一个共产主义者。我相信学校是好的，是为我的发展服务的。从那以后，我改变了。

If you capture a potential slave, he is likely to react violently. However, it is also possible to enslave people incrementally and meet no reaction. Children are enslaved week by week at school. It is like slowly heating up a frog to death. Children gradually conform to an increasing level of discipline and oppression. They can no longer see a way out. They no longer see a problem. They accept the status quo as inevitable. They can also absorb school propaganda as the sole sacred truth.

如果你抓住了一个潜在的奴隶，他很可能会做出激烈的反应。然而，也有可能逐步地奴役人，而不会遇到任何反抗。孩子们在学校周而复始地被奴役。这就像慢慢地把一只青蛙加热至死。孩子们逐渐顺应越来越多的纪律和压迫。他们再也看不到出路。他们不再看到问题。他们接受现状是不可避免的。他们也能吸收学校的宣传，作为唯一神圣的真理。

Communism enslaved my mind by schooling and information monopoly. It was a gradual absorption of ideas based on incomplete information. I became realistic about communism only when [I learned English](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Schools_are_useless_in_teaching_English), and learned about the world beyond Poland (in my mid twenties).

共产主义通过学校教育和信息垄断来奴役我的思想。那是在不完全信息的基础上逐渐吸收的思想。只有当我学会了英语，了解了波兰以外的世界时，我才对共产主义有了现实的认识（在我二十多岁的时候）。

I became realistic about school thanks to [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading), which serves as a great metaphor for efficient [free learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_learning). However, I was always a happily indoctrinated student. This is why I still needed some help from children unhappy with school. Their faces told me the rest of the story. In college, I transformed my school, and tailored it to my needs. In the years 1987-1990, school truly served me well because I took it out of the equation (see: [How I invented perfect schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_I_invented_perfect_schooling)). This made me insensitive to the myth of *good school*, and kept me blind for many years. Like an incrementally boiled frog, I did not ever sense the badness of school.

我对学校变得现实了，这要归功于渐进阅读，它是高效自由学习的一个很好的比喻。然而，我始终是一个快乐的被灌输的学生。这就是为什么我还是需要一些对学校不满意的孩子的帮助。他们的脸告诉了我剩下的故事。在大学里，我对学校进行了改造，并根据自己的需要对学校进行了改造。在 1987-1990 年，学校真正为我服务，因为我把它从等式中抽离出来（见：我如何发明完美的学校教育）。这让我对好学校的神话不敏感，让我盲目了很多年。就像一只渐渐被煮熟的青蛙，我从来没有感受到学校的坏处。

It is possible to enslave people incrementally and meet no opposition

可以渐渐地奴役人，并不会遇到反对的声音。

# Are kids bound to stray without schooling?

# 孩子们不上学就一定会流浪吗？

I tried to quantify the degree of abysmal failure of schooling in expanding my knowledge. Schools were [16-50 times slower](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_history:_school_vs._self-directed_learning#Growth_of_my_knowledge_of_history) in expanding my own knowledge of history than was my own life free of schooling. In my investigations, I chose the subject of history because history is not part of my job. It is just interesting. Even if you take a correction for the fact that I compare the more mature half of my life with the less mature half, the numbers are still staggering.

我试图量化学校教育在拓展知识方面的糟糕失败程度。学校在拓展自己的历史知识方面，比我自己没有学校教育的生活要慢 16-50 倍。在我的调查中，我选择了历史学科，因为历史不是我工作的一部分。它只是有趣。即使你把我比较成熟的半辈子和不太成熟的半辈子做一个修正，这个数字也是惊人的。

When I say kids should decide their own learning direction, I keep hearing of those stray kids that may play video games all day, spend their days on collecting baseball cards, or study UFOs and aliens. [Sudbury Valley School](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sudbury_Valley_School) proves that prediction to be wrong.

当我说孩子们应该决定自己的学习方向时，我一直听到那些流浪的孩子，他们可能会整天玩电子游戏，把时间花在收集棒球卡上，或者研究 UFO 和外星人。萨德伯里谷学校证明这种预测是错误的。

Some proponents of schooling say: the kid [needs to know the multiplication table](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Toxic_memory) or where the north is. Otherwise he won't be able to find her place in modern economy. I agree that basic knowledge is vital. However, kids master basic knowledge with or without schooling. By the age of 12-13, most kids know where the north is. I learned that before school from my brother. I could find north using the sun and a watch, before I could read the watch itself. The questions is: *Do all kids need to know who Julian Kawalec is?* If you don't know Kawalec, see [how I nearly failed to graduate because of not knowing details from Kawalec book](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Why_I_do_not_read_books). Do all kids need to know all affluents of Amazon? I love geography, but I struggle to admit I have problems with recalling even one affluent despite the fact that I find all things related to Amazon rainforest highly interesting.

一些学校教育的支持者说：孩子需要知道乘法表或者北方在哪里。否则他将无法在现代经济中找到她的位置。我同意基础知识是至关重要的。但是，不管有没有上学，孩子们都会掌握基本知识。在12-13岁的时候，大多数孩子都知道北方在哪里。我上学前就从我哥哥那里学到了。我可以用太阳和手表找到北方，在我能读懂手表本身之前。问题是。所有的孩子都需要知道 Julian Kawalec 是谁吗? 如果你不知道 Kawalec，看看我是如何因为不知道 Kawalec 书中的细节而差点没毕业的。所有的孩子都需要知道亚马逊的所有富豪吗？我喜欢地理，但我努力承认，尽管我觉得所有与亚马逊雨林有关的东西都非常有趣，但我却连回忆一个富裕的地方都有问题。

All those reservations and doubts about self-directed learning come from those who got accustomed to being led by national curricula, teachers, and set rules for learning. The doubts come from those who do not believe in the power of human self-determination and those who do not believe in their own powers.

所有那些对自主学习的保留和怀疑，都来自于那些习惯于被国家课程、老师和既定的学习规则引导的人。这些疑虑来自于那些不相信人的自我决定的力量，不相信自己的力量的人。

This reminds me of the old communist argument that the state knows best what citizens need, while a rogue enterpreneur might abuse its workers, produce harmful products, or just focus solely on enriching himself rather than working for the good of society. I grew up in the communist system. I was indoctrinated by the rigid communist curriculum. It took me quite a while to understand why central control over economy isn't as effective as free market optimization. However, at the age of 14, I already had no doubt that self-directed learning is vastly superior to learning imposed by a teacher.

这让我想起了共产主义的老论调，国家最知道公民需要什么，而一个无赖的企业家可能会虐待工人，生产有害的产品，或者只顾着中饱私囊，而不是为社会谋福利。我是在共产主义制度下长大的。我被僵化的共产主义课程所灌输。我花了相当长的时间才明白为什么中央控制经济不如自由市场优化有效。然而，在 14 岁的时候，我已经毫不怀疑，自主学习比老师强加的学习要优越很多。

This gave me a hint to formulate the **Soviet 5-year-plan metaphor** of modern schooling. Metaphors in my texts are no proof. They are just a different way of illustrating my reasoning:

这给了我一个暗示，让我制定了现代学校教育的**苏联 5 年计划比喻**。我文中的比喻不是证明。它们只是我说明理由的另一种方式：

# Schooling is like Soviet Economy

# 学校教育就像苏联经济

Each learning decision made by a child in self-directed learning can be compared to an economic decision made by an enterpreneur in a free market. Similarly, national curricula, often [written in a hurry to meet contingent needs](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Polish_education_reform), must be imposed from above like a Soviet 5-year economic plan that used to be imposed on the proletariat.

孩子在自主学习中做出的每一个学习决策，都可以比喻为自由市场中企业家做出的经济决策。同样，国家的课程，往往是为了满足偶然的需要而匆忙编写的，必须像过去苏联的五年经济计划一样，从上面强加给无产阶级。

Child should self-direct and obtain minor nudges to its trajectory from the whole village of his social circle. The prime trajectory corrector should always be the parent. Usually, this is the only mature adult brain that should be able to keep an accurate model of where the child is and make the most accurate prediction of where the child is going.

孩子应该自我引导，从他的社交圈全村获得对其轨迹的轻微推敲。首要的轨迹校正者应该永远是父母。通常情况下，这是唯一成熟的成人大脑，应该能够保持孩子所在的准确模型，并对孩子的去向做出最准确的预测。

Skeptics reply that parents can be biased or backward, while teachers follow the curriculum which is a result of a national consensus. Using the economic metaphor, one might claim that the communist system is superior because the government is best to set the production parameters for a factory. After all, the government is armed with the expert consensus, while a factory owner might be uneducated or drunk. National curricula can indeed provide a good guidance for parents and teachers, but reliance on individual choices is superior. I support Common Core as an inspiration, and nothing more than an inspiration.

怀疑论者回答说，家长可能会有偏见或落后，而老师则是按照课程表来做，这是全国共识的结果。用经济的比喻，可能会说共产主义制度更优越，因为政府最适合设定工厂的生产参数。毕竟，政府掌握着专家的共识，而工厂主可能是没有文化的，或者是酒鬼。国家课程确实可以为家长和老师提供一个很好的指导，但依靠个人的选择是优越的。我支持共同核心是一种激励，也不过是一种激励。

**5-year-plan metaphor of compulsory learning**

**5年计划比喻义务学习**

All great economic and educational plans start with priming the populus with some high-flying propaganda. Stalin would promise to industrialize the union. Caregivers at pre-school level keep extolling the virtues of schooling and how it transforms societies.

所有伟大的经济和教育计划都是从用一些高大上的宣传来引导民众开始的。斯大林会承诺将联盟工业化。学前教育阶段的护理人员不断地颂扬学校教育的优点，以及它如何改变社会。

The 5-year-plan begins with a God-like figure in the like of Stalin. Schooling plans begin with a God-like minister of education who can move schools and millions of people in directions of her choice with a stroke of a pen. The God-like figure got its army of executioners: party bosses, and teachers. Primed by propaganda, dazzled workers and first grade students get down to the plan with great enthusiasm.

5 年计划从一个像斯大林一样的神一样的人物开始。学校教育计划始于一个神一样的教育部长，她可以用一支笔把学校和千百万人往她选择的方向移动。这个神一样的人物有了它的刽子手大军：党魁，和教师。在宣传的引导下，眼花缭乱的工人和一年级的学生们以极大的热情投入到计划中去。

Then the actual work and suffering begin. The torment and injustice affects those who take the greatest burden in executing the plan or those who stand in the way. The suffering extends to workers, peasants, school directors, teachers, and students.

然后，实际的工作和痛苦开始了。痛苦和不公正影响着那些在执行计划中承担最大负担的人，或者那些阻碍计划的人。苦难的范围包括工人、农民、学校负责人、教师和学生。

There is always a temptation to go for better targets: more productivity, more corn, more revenue, more graduates, better test scores, better school rank, etc. Educators lament that the country dropped by a number of positions on international test score lists. As a result, global goals get cranked up, and the country's position improves. But then some other country drops and engages in the similar zero-game strategy. Global goals get cranked up again. However, the goals are not matched by local resources and capacities. Many investments were reported as completed, while in reality they stood half-done unused wasteful or abandoned. Many student projects end with a credit, while in reality there is little applicability, or little knowledge, or little understanding, or just little to show. All failures and shortcomings end with more regulations and more red tape. Bureaucracy tends to take over economies and young lives.

人们总想去追求更好的指标：更多的生产力、更多的玉米、更多的收入、更多的毕业生、更好的考试成绩、更好的学校排名等等。教育工作者感叹，国家在国际考试分数榜上下降了不少名次。结果，全球目标被调高了，国家的地位也提高了。但是，又有其他国家下降，并进行类似的零游戏策略。全球目标又被调高了。然而，当地的资源和能力与这些目标并不匹配。许多投资被报告为已经完成，而实际上它们却停留在半途而废，未被利用的浪费或放弃。许多学生项目以学分告终，而实际上应用性不强，或知之甚少，或了解甚少，或只是很少的展示。所有的失败和缺憾都以更多的规章制度和更多的繁文缛节而告终。官僚主义往往会占据经济和年轻的生命。

As much as statistical fudging and lying was part of Soviet 5-year-plans, cheating and lying is a norm at school. It is proportional to the pressure exerted in the quest to meet curriculum goals. It is proportional to the volume of the imposed material. Both produce great results in statistics and poor results in actual measures of well-being or learning. Targets are often met, but global success does not translate to the satisfaction at the local level.

就像统计学上的造假和撒谎是苏联五年计划的一部分一样，作弊和撒谎在学校是一种常态。它与追求课程目标时施加的压力成正比。它与强加的教材量成正比。两者都会在统计学上产生巨大的结果，而在衡量福祉或学习的实际措施上却效果不佳。目标往往能够实现，但全球的成功并不能转化为地方一级的满意。

Communist economies and school systems also suffer their major injustices and disasters. Stalin hushed up the Great Famine. Schooling comes with global epidemics in bullying, [ADHD](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Confusing_creativity_with_ADHD), drug abuse, sleep disorders, obesity, suicide, and more.

共产主义经济和学校系统也遭受了其主要的不公正和灾难。斯大林掩盖了大饥荒。学校教育伴随着欺凌、多动症、药物滥用、睡眠障碍、肥胖、自杀等全球流行病。

State paternalism can results in inefficiency or harm. The end result is that in the communist economy, and in the modern education system, most of the participants end up unhappy.

国家家长制会导致效率低下或伤害。最终的结果是，在共产主义经济中，以及现代教育体系中，大多数参与者最终都不幸福。

Contrast it with the thriving free market spirit of Silicon Valley, or happy faces of [homeschoolers](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Homeschooling) who never lost their [joy of learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Pleasure_of_learning).

与硅谷欣欣向荣的自由市场精神，或者家庭教育者从未失去学习乐趣的幸福面孔形成鲜明对比。

**Perfect competition vs. perfect learning machines**

**完美竞争 VS 完美学习机器**

Someone can question my Soviet economy metaphor saying that kids have immature brains while an entrepreneur is guided by a rational mature mind.

有人可以质疑我的苏联经济比喻说，孩子的大脑不成熟，而企业家则是由理性成熟的头脑引导。

I would say the opposite is true. It is the kid who has been designed by millions of years of evolution to be a mathematically optimized [perfect learning machine](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive). They have an innate program for optimally structuring the semantic network of knowledge in their brains. I mention elsewhere that a kid is also a [perfectly forgetting machine](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Childhood_amnesia). I need to add that forgetting is a vital component of the neural generalization and abstraction program that is part of that perfect learning machine. This makes for a system that is smarter than your best AI learning machines yet. This biological system can get you from a blob of living matter to an intelligent human robot that takes on goals and zeros in on its target along an efficient trajectory. In terms of decision-making, what happens automatically in a baby brain is more efficient than what happens in a thinking brain of an entrepreneur. This is because the automatic and autonomous control of the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) emergent in neural networks is more suited for detecting quality learnable knowledge than the "rational" control employed by a businessman in his market analysis. The latter needs to work under the constraints of imperfect knowledge and set targets, independent of how realistic they are. Kids are free from this constraint and will soak in new knowledge at optimum speed set by the capacity of their brain and their experiential exposure. Their brains automatically detect quality.

我想说的是，事实恰恰相反。是孩子被数百万年的进化设计成了一个数学优化的完美学习机器。他们有一个与生俱来的程序来优化大脑中的知识语义网络结构。我在其他地方提到，一个孩子也是一个完美的遗忘机器。我需要补充的是，遗忘是神经泛化和抽象程序的重要组成部分，而神经泛化和抽象程序是那台完美学习机器的一部分。这使得这个系统比你最好的人工智能学习机还聪明。这个生物系统可以让你从一个生物物质的小球变成一个智能的人类机器人，沿着高效的轨迹接受目标并锁定目标。在决策方面，婴儿大脑中自动发生的事情比企业家的思维大脑中发生的事情更有效率。这是因为神经网络中出现的学习驱动的自动和自主控制，比商人在市场分析中采用的 "理性" 控制更适合检测高质量的可学习知识。后者需要在不完全知识的约束下工作，并设定目标，与目标的现实性无关。孩子们则不受这种约束，他们会以大脑容量和经验接触所设定的最佳速度吸收新知识。他们的大脑会自动检测质量。

Kids will learn to walk even if we disrupt their efforts with various accelerations efforts (e.g. walking machines that interfere with the natural motor skill development program). Kids will learn to speak on their own. No targeted tutoring needed. All they need is speech on input and the drive to accomplish goals via speech communication. Check your two neighbors, one is going out of his way to make his kid speak fast, and count fast, and perhaps read early. The other does nothing and his kid can still surprise and win that developmental race. Smart kids may develop slowly. On the other hand, accelerated kids can slow down due to the interference with their natural learning program. The problem with inept acceleration is that it may leave a permanent mark on the ultimate outcome.

孩子们会学会走路，即使我们用各种加速的努力（如走路机，干扰了自然运动技能的发展计划）来打断他们的努力。孩子们会自己学会说话。不需要有针对性的辅导。他们需要的是输入时的语言，以及通过语言交流完成目标的动力。看看你的两个邻居，一个是想尽办法让孩子说得快，数得快，也许还能早读。另一个什么都不做，他的孩子仍然可以出奇制胜，赢得这场发展竞赛。聪明的孩子可能发展缓慢。另一方面，加速的孩子可能会因为自然学习程序的干扰而放慢速度。无能的加速的问题是，它可能会给最终的结果留下永久的印记。

Businesses and kids often chose their paths using semi-rational criteria. They will follow their natural preferences and interests. A capitalist may want to turn his hobby into a job. A child may prefer reading Pinocchio over studying math. Every great CEO, inventor or a billionaire will tell you that you need to love what you do. Otherwise the results will be as bad as the productivity in the Soviet economy known for its worker's adage: "*if you toil or if you sleep, 50 rubles you will reap*".

企业和孩子们经常会用半理性的标准来选择自己的道路。他们会遵循自己的自然喜好和兴趣。一个资本家可能想把自己的爱好变成工作。一个孩子可能更喜欢阅读《匹诺曹》而不是学习数学。每一个伟大的 CEO、发明家或亿万富翁都会告诉你，你需要热爱你的工作。否则，结果会像苏联经济的生产力一样糟糕，因为它的工人格言："如果你劳作或睡觉，你将收获 50 卢布"。

# Robinson's fast food metaphor

# 罗宾逊的快餐比喻

Schooling and centrally-governed economies use a similar inefficient control system. Control theory is not popularly understood in general population, however, most of people know the power of free markets. This is what led me to proposing the above Soviet economy metaphor.

学校教育和中央管理的经济都使用类似的低效控制体系。控制理论在普通民众中并不被普遍理解，然而，大多数人都知道自由市场的力量。这就是我提出上述苏联经济比喻的原因。

Ken Robinson is one of the briskiest minds involved in the criticism of current educational models. He proposed a better metaphor of schooling. Instead of control theory, he evoked optimization strategies. Schooling goes for high volumes at low costs. The same happens in food industry. The harm done by industrialization of schooling is not yet fully understood, however, we all know the health harm caused by the fast food industry. For fast food metaphor of schooling see: [Ken Robinson's "Bring on the learning revolution!"](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Schools_do_not_tolerate_diversity) on YouTube.

肯-罗宾逊是参与批评现行教育模式的最粗犷的头脑之一。他提出了一个更好的学校教育比喻。他引出的不是控制理论，而是优化策略。学校教育追求的是低成本大批量。食品工业也是如此。学校教育产业化所带来的危害还没有完全了解，然而，我们都知道快餐业对健康的危害。关于快餐对学校教育的比喻，请参见：肯-罗宾逊的 "带来学习革命！"在 YouTube 上。

Robinson says:

罗宾逊说：

> We have to go from what is essentially an industrial model of education, a manufacturing model, which is based on linearity and conformity and batching people. We have to move to a model that is based more on principles of agriculture. We have to recognize that human flourishing is not a mechanical process; it's an organic process. And you cannot predict the outcome of human development. All you can do, like a farmer, is create the conditions under which they will begin to flourish
>
> 
>
> 我们必须从本质上的工业教育模式中走出来 一个基于线性和一致性以及批量化的制造模式。我们必须转向一种更基于农业原则的模式。我们必须认识到，人的成长不是一个机械的过程，而是一个有机的过程。而且你无法预测人发展的结果。你所能做的，就像一个农民一样，就是创造条件，让他们开始蓬勃发展。

## Finnish paradox

## 芬兰悖论

[Compulsory schooling must end](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling_must_end). This should be obvious with a bit of understanding of the theory of learning. However, the entire western world seems to be trying to optimize a wrong design. In [Finnish paradox](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Finnish_paradox), I show how Finnish schools lead the world in being open to new ideas. However, they also may keep optimizing the dead end of school that is not fully committed to [free learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_learning). In that sense, Finland is a bit like Soviet Union 1957. Everyone was in awe with Sputnik. Many people had doubts about the superiority of free markets over the command economy. However, the proletariat of the communist empire did not fully subscribe to the ideology. Many people in the East could see the richest of the West and wondered why they cannot freely vote for parties that might perhaps change a thing or two. Many students can perfectly see the harm of coercion, but they have no vote. Parents, teachers and politicians are too busy with their lives and do not fully appreciate the pain of schooling. They live with the myth that "school is good". Finnish students are obedient and compliant. This is reminiscent to the well-indoctrinated population (I was one of those compliant souls: [I stopped being a patriot](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/I_stopped_being_a_patriot)). As much as we needed Lech Walesa and other rebels, we need now young rebels who would help change the school system. It will be hard to find such rebels in Finland. Finnish system is too good. I bet on Eastern Europe (perhaps Poland?). Our students are smart, rebellious, unhappy, and the system is almost as bad as the Soviet Union in the days leading to its collapse.

义务教育必须结束。只要对学习理论稍有了解，这应该是显而易见的。然而，整个西方世界似乎都在试图优化一个错误的设计。在《芬兰悖论》中，我展示了芬兰学校如何引领世界对新思想的开放。然而，他们也可能不断优化没有完全致力于自由学习的学校死角。在这个意义上，芬兰有点像 1957 年的苏联。每个人都对斯普特尼克心存敬畏。很多人对自由市场比命令经济的优越性产生了怀疑。然而，共产主义帝国的无产阶级并不完全认同这种意识形态。许多东方人可以看到西方最富有的人，他们想知道为什么他们不能自由地投票给那些或许可以改变一两件事情的政党。很多学生完全可以看到强制的危害，但他们没有投票权。家长、老师和政治家们忙于生活，并没有完全体会到学校教育的痛苦。他们生活在 "学校好" 的神话中。芬兰的学生很听话，很顺从。这让人联想到那些受到良好教育的民众（我就是那些顺从的灵魂之一：我不再是一个爱国者）。就像我们需要莱赫-瓦文萨和其他反叛者一样，我们现在也需要年轻的反叛者，他们会帮助改变学校制度。在芬兰很难找到这样的叛逆者。芬兰的制度太好。我把赌注押在东欧（也许是波兰？我们的学生聪明、叛逆、不快乐，而且这个制度几乎和苏联崩溃前的日子一样糟糕。

Compulsory schooling may need a bloodless rebellion for its complete eradication

义务教育可能需要一场不流血的叛乱才能彻底根除

# Compulsory SuperMemo

# 强制 SuperMemo

I often hear the opinion: *"double teacher salary, you will quadruple the efficiency of the system"*. Unfortunately, few areas of government investment bring such nice returns. If it was all so easy, we should invest in governments, not in stocks.

我经常听到这样的观点 "教师工资翻倍，系统效率就会翻两番"。遗憾的是，很少有政府投资领域能带来这么好的回报。如果一切都这么简单，我们应该投资政府，而不是投资股票。

Imagine what would happen, if governments decided to make [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo) compulsory at schools! 1-2% of kids might catch that hook. The rest of the students would turn into lifelong [SuperMemo haters](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Hating_SuperMemo). Done wrongly, SuperMemo could do more damage than good. [Badly formulated](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/20_rules) unwanted knowledge is comparable to [information garbage](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Toxic_memory). With bad knowledge, SuperMemo would be turned into a perfect schooling torture machine. Perfect tool for efficient time-wasting and suppression of the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive). It would result in [cramming](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Cramming) and reviewing garbage!

想象一下，如果政府决定在学校强制推行 SuperMemo，会发生什么？1-2% 的孩子可能会上钩。其余的学生会变成终生讨厌 SuperMemo 的人。如果做得不对，SuperMemo 可能弊大于利。制订不好的不需要的知识，堪比信息垃圾。糟糕的知识，SuperMemo 会变成一台完美的学校教育拷问机器。完美的工具，高效的时间浪费和学习动力的压制。会导致补习和复习的垃圾!

In the [optimum education system](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Reform), all learning must [come from the heart](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Fundamental_law_of_learning). Good learning must be governed by the [pleasures](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Pleasure_of_learning) generated by the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive).

在最优的教育体系中，所有的学习都必须发自内心。好的学习必须由学习动力产生的乐趣来支配。

Bad employment of [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo) might suppress the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive)!

糟糕的 SuperMemo 使用可能会压制学习动力！

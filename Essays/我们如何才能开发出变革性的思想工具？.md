Part of the origin myth of modern computing is the story of a golden age in the 1960s and 1970s. In this story, visionary pioneers pursued a dream in which computers enabled powerful tools for thought, that is, tools to augment human intelligence[^1]. One of those pioneers, Alan Kay, summed up the optimism of this dream when he wrote of the potential of the personal computer: “the very use of it would actually change the thought patterns of an entire civilization”[^2].

谈起关于计算机起源的那些神话, 总是绕不开被称为「黄金年代」的上世纪60与70年代. 在那段时间里, 许多高瞻远瞩的开拓者都在追逐着一个梦想, 即使计算机能够成为强大的思想工具, 也就是能增强人类智力的工具[^1]. 这些开拓者中的一位, Alan Key, 在写到个人电脑的潜力时, 总结了他们对这个梦想的乐观愿景: 「它(计算机)的使用将会改变整个文明的思维模式」[^2]. 

It’s an inspiring dream, which helped lead to modern interactive graphics, windowing interfaces, word processors, and much else. But retrospectively it’s difficult not to be disappointed, to feel that computers have not yet been nearly as transformative as far older tools for thought, such as language and writing. Today, it’s common in technology circles to pay lip service to the pioneering dreams of the past. But nostalgia aside there is little determined effort to pursue the vision of transformative new tools for thought.

这无疑是个振奋人心的梦想, 也帮助促成了许多伟大发明如现代交互式图形界面, 视窗界面, 字处理软件等等. 但是回顾过去, 我们还是不免感到失望, 因为计算机还是没有像语言和文字这些早期思想工具那样给整个文明的思维模式带来了变革性的影响.  当今, 科技界都会拿这些开拓者的梦想来耍嘴皮子. 但他们除了怀旧, 几乎没有为创造变革性的新思想工具的愿景做出任何一点坚定的努力. 

We believe now is a good time to work hard on this vision again. In this essay we sketch out a set of ideas we believe can be used to help develop transformative new tools for thought. In the first part of the essay we describe an experimental prototype system that we’ve built, a kind of *mnemonic medium* intended to augment human memory. This is a snapshot of an ongoing project, detailing both encouraging progress as well as many challenges and opportunities. In the second part of the essay, we broaden the focus. We sketch several other prototype systems. And we address the question: why is it that the technology industry has made comparatively little effort developing this vision of transformative tools for thought?

我们相信现在是就是为这这个愿景努力奋斗的恰当时机. 在这篇文章中, 我们勾勒了一系列用来帮助开发变革性的新思想工具的想法. 文章的第一部分, 我们描述了一套我们开发的实验性的系统, 该系统是一种记忆媒介的原型, 旨在增强人们的记忆. 这一部分文字相当于这个还在进行中的项目的一个快照, 详细介绍了一些令人鼓舞的进展以及许多机遇和挑战. 在第文章的第二部分, 我们扩展了讨论的范围. 我们对其他几个原型系统进行了概述, 还讨论了这样一个问题: 为什么业界不愿意花力气开发变革性思想工具?

In the opening we mentioned some visionaries of the past. To those could be added many others – Ivan Sutherland, Seymour Papert, Vannevar Bush, and more. Online there is much well-deserved veneration for these people. But such veneration can veer into an unhealthy reverence for the good old days, a belief that giants once roamed the earth, and today’s work is lesser. Yes, those pioneers did amazing things, and arguably had ways of working that modern technologists, in both industry and academia, are poorly equipped to carry on. But they also made mistakes, and were ignorant of powerful ideas that are available today. And so a theme through both parts of the essay is to identify powerful ideas that weren’t formerly known or weren’t acted upon. Out of this understanding arises a conviction that a remarkable set of opportunities is open today.

在文章的开头我们提到了一些开拓者的名字, 实际上这样的开拓者还有很多, 如Ivan Sutherland, Seymour Papert, Vannevar Bush等等. 在网络上对这些先贤都有着很高的评价. 当然, 他们都配得上这些评价, 但是这种崇敬可能会演变成过分拔高那段以前的岁月, 进而认为只有那个年代才出大师, 现代人的工作则没有那么重要. 是, 这些大师确实做出了惊艳的成果, 甚至可以说他们的工作模式是现代的学者或技术专家都没有能力继承的. 但是他们也会犯错, 他们也会对一些在现在被认为十分有用的想法感到一无所知.  因此, 贯穿全文的一个主题是找出那些以前不为人知或没有被应用的有用的想法. 从这个主题上也会衍生出一个信念, 即现在还是有许多非凡的想法等待着被发现. 

A word on nomenclature: the term “tools for thought” rolls off neither the tongue nor the keyboard. What’s more, the term “tool” implies a certain narrowness. Alan Kay has arguedAgain, in Alan Kay, [User Interface: A Personal View](https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/Kay1989.pdf) (1989), among other places. that a more powerful aim is to develop a new *medium for thought*. A medium such as, say, Adobe *Illustrator* is essentially different from any of the individual tools *Illustrator* contains. Such a medium creates a powerful immersive context, a context in which the user can have new kinds of thought, thoughts that were formerly impossible for them. Speaking loosely, the range of expressive thoughts possible in such a medium is an emergent property of the elementary objects and actions in that medium. If those are well chosen, the medium expands the possible range of human thought.

下面来解释一下「思想工具」这个名字.  「工具」这个词是经过审慎选择的. 在这里,  「工具」有着狭义的指代. Alan Kay曾经说过[^3],  (相比于开发思想工具)一个更有力的目标是开发一个新的思想媒介. 比如说, Adobe Illustrator这样的媒介在本质上不同于其所包含的任何单个工具. 这样的媒介创造了一个强大的沉浸式环境, 在这个环境中, 用户可以迸发出新的思想, 以前不可能有的思想. 笼统地说, 在这样的媒介中, 能表达出思想的范围是该媒介的组成元素和其中的工具的一个自然属性.[^Mass Point 1]如果这些东西选择得好, 这种媒介就会扩大人类思想的疆界. 

With that said, the term “tools for thought” has been widely used since Iverson’s 1950s and 1960s workAn account may be found in Iverson’s Turing Award lecture, [Notation as a Tool of Thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/Iverson1979.pdf) (1979). Incidentally, even Iverson is really describing a medium for thought, the APL programming language, not a narrow tool. introducing the term. And so we shall use “tools for thought” as our catch all phrase, while giving ourselves license to explore a broader range, and also occasionally preferring the term “medium” when it is apt.

说到这里, 「思想工具」这个词自从Iverson[^4]在20世纪50年代和60年代的工作以来一直被广泛使用. 因此, 我们也会尽可能使用 「思想工具」一词, 同时我们也可能扩大外延, 偶尔在合适的时候用「媒介」这个词. 

Let’s come back to that phrase from the opening, about changing “the thought patterns of an entire civilization”. It sounds ludicrous, a kind of tech soothsaying. Except, of course, such changes have happened multiple times during human history: the development of language, of writing, and our other most powerful tools for thought. And, for better and worse, computers really have affected the thought patterns of our civilization over the past 60 years, and those changes seem like just the beginning. This essay is a small contribution to understanding how such changes happen, and what is still possible.

让我们回到开头的那句话, 「改变整个文明的思维模式 」. 这听起来很荒唐, 像是一种卜辞. 然而, 这种变化在人类历史上已经发生过多次: 语言和文字的发展, 以及其他强大的「思想工具」. 而且, 无论如何, 计算机在过去60年里确实影响了人类文明的思维模式, 并且这些变化似乎只是个开始. 本文试图对理解这种变化是如何发生的, 以及还有什么仍可能发生做了一些微小的贡献. 

The musician and comedian Martin Mull has observed that “writing about music is like dancing about architecture”. In a similar way, there’s an inherent inadequacy in writing about tools for thought. To the extent that such a tool succeeds, it expands your thinking beyond what can be achieved using existing tools, including writing. The more transformative the tool, the larger the gap that is opened. Conversely, the larger the gap, the more difficult the new tool is to evoke in writing. But what writing can do, and the reason we wrote this essay, is act as a bootstrap. It’s a way of identifying points of leverage that may help develop new tools for thought. So let’s get on with it.

音乐家, 喜剧演员Martin Mull说过, 「Writing about music is like dancing about architecture.[^译1]」, 「写」这种思想工具也有内在的不足. 以新的思想工具的成功程度而言, 它扩展了你的思维, 超过了现有工具(包括写作)所能达到的程度. 工具的变革性越强, 所撕开的缺口就越大. 反之, 撕开的缺口越大, 这种新工具就越难用写作表达清楚. 但是写作始终可以做的是起一个引导者的作用, 这也是我们写这篇文章的原因. 写作是确定杠杆点的一种方式, 可能会有助于新思想工具的开发. 所以让我们继续吧. [^Mass Point 2]

# Part I: Memory systems

# 第一部分：记忆系统

## Introducing the mnemonic

## 介绍记忆媒介

Few subjects are more widely regarded as difficult than quantum computing and quantum mechanics. Indeed, popular media accounts often regale (and intimidate) readers with quotes from famous physicists in the vein of: “anyone who thinks they’ve understood quantum mechanics has not understood quantum mechanics”.

量子力学和量子计算通常被认为是最艰涩的学科.主流媒体也常常用引用著名物理学家的名言诸如“任何认为自己已经理解了量子力学的人都没有理解量子力学”来去安慰（和恐吓）读者.

What makes these subjects difficult? In fact, individually many of the underlying ideas are not too complicated for people with a technical background. But the ideas come in an overwhelming number, a tsunami of unfamiliar concepts and notation. People must learn in rapid succession of qubits, the bra-ket notation, Hadamard gates, controlled-not gates, and many, many other abstract, unfamiliar notions. They’re imbibing an entire new language. Even if they can follow at first, understanding later ideas requires fluency with all the earlier ideas. It’s overwhelming and eventually disheartening.

是什么让这些科目变得如此困难? 其实对于有学科背景的人来说, 许多基本的想法单拎出来都不是很复杂.但是这些想法往往是以压倒性的数量同时出现的, 随之而来的还有狂风骤雨般陌生的概念和符号.人们必须飞快地接二连三学习量子比特、Bra-ket符号、Hadamard门、受控否闸以及其它抽象且陌生的符号——他们正在吸收一种全新的语言.即使他们一开始能跟上, 但他们对这些新想法的熟练度并不足以让他们去接着学后面的想法.这让人不知所措, 最终感到沮丧.[^Mass Point 3]

As an experiment, we have developed a website, [*Quantum Country*](https://quantum.country/), which explores a new approach to explaining quantum computing and quantum mechanics. Ostensibly, *Quantum Country* appears to be a conventional essay introduction to these subjects. There is text, explanations, and equations, much as in any other technical essay. Here’s an excerpt:

出于实验目的, 我们开发了[量子国度](https://quantum.country/)这个网站, 以在探索一种解释量子计算和量子力学的新方法.表面上看, 量子国度和那些介绍这些主题的传统文章没什么两样——有文字, 有说明, 有方程.下面是一个内容摘录: 

![Screenshot depicting prose and math in Quantum Country, typical of a technical essay.](https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/quantum_country_sample-2x.png)

But it’s not a conventional essay. Rather, *Quantum Country* is a prototype for a new type of *mnemonic medium*. Aspirationally, the mnemonic medium makes it almost effortless for users to remember what they read. That may sound like an impossible aspiration. What makes it plausible is that cognitive scientists know a considerable amount about how human beings store long-term memories. Indeed, what they know can almost be distilled to an actionable recipe: follow these steps, and you can remember whatever you choose.

不过这和那些传统文章还是有很大区别的.量子国度实际上一种新的记忆媒介的原型.在我们的设想中, 记忆媒介可以帮助用户不费吹灰之力地记住他们读过的内容.这听上去是个不可能实现的愿望, 但是由于认知科学家已经对人类存储长期记忆的机制有了相当多的了解, 实际上并非遥不可及.认知科学家们所了解的事实基本上可以提炼成一个可操作的清单: 按照里面的步骤, 你可以记住任何你想要记的东西.[^Mass Point 4]

Unfortunately, those steps are poorly supported by existing media.For more on this argument, see Andy Matuschak, [Why books don’t work](https://andymatuschak.org/books/) (2019). Is it possible to design a new medium which much more actively supports memorization? That is, the medium would build in (and, ideally, make almost effortless) the key steps involved in memory. If we could do this, then instead of memory being a haphazard event, subject to chance, the mnemonic medium would make memory into a choice. Of course, on its own this wouldn’t make it trivial to learn subjects such as quantum mechanics and quantum computing – learning those subjects is about much more than memory. But it would help in addressing one core difficulty: the overwhelming number of new concepts and notation.

不幸的是, 现有媒介对这些步骤的支持很差.[^5]有没有可能设计一种能主动协助记忆的新媒介? 也就是说, 记忆——最好是不费吹灰之力地记忆——的关键步骤被集成在了这个媒介里.如果我们能做到这一点, 那么记忆将不再是一个杂乱无章、充满不确定性的事件而变成只不过是一种选择.当然, 就其本身而言, 这不会使学习量子力学和量子计算等学科变得简单——学习这些学科需要的远不止是记忆.但这种媒介将有助于解决一个核心障碍: 新的概念和符号太多.

In fact, there are many ways of redesigning the essay medium to do that. Before showing you our prototype, please pause for a moment and consider the following questions: how could you build a medium to better support a person’s memory of what they read? What interactions could easily and enjoyably help people consolidate memories? And, more broadly: is it possible to 2x what people remember? 10x? And would that make any long-term difference to their effectiveness?

事实上, 有许多方法都可以用来重新组织文本媒介以达到这一点.在向你展示我们的原型之前, 请停顿片刻, 思考以下问题: 如何制作一个媒介来更好地帮助一个人记忆他们所读的内容? 有哪些互动可以轻松愉快地帮助人们巩固记忆? 以及, 更一般地说: 有没有办法能让人们的记忆效率翻上两倍甚至十倍? 这是否会对他们的效率产生长期的影响? 

Let’s sketch the user experience of *Quantum Country*. At the time of this writing the site contains three mnemonic essays (i.e., particular instances of the mnemonic medium). We’ll focus on the introductory essay, [“Quantum Computing for the Very Curious”](https://quantum.country/qcvc). Embedded within the text of the essay are 112 questions about that text. Users are asked to create an account, and quizzed as they read on whether they remember the answers to those questions. Here’s what the interaction looks like, as a user answers three questions.

让我们简要概括一下量子国度的用户体验.在写这篇文章的时候, 该网站包含三篇记忆性文章(即记忆性媒介的一个特定实体).我们将重点关注第一篇, ["写给好奇者的量子计算引论"](https://quantum.country/qcvc).在这篇文章中我们嵌入了112个关于文本的问题.用户被要求注册一个账号, 并在阅读过程中回答他们是否记得这些问题的答案.下面是一个用户回答其中三个问题时的互动情况.[^Mass Point 5]

https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/qc_interaction.mp4

https://www.zhihu.com/zvideo/1377723672250126336

Note that this interaction occurs within the text of the essay itself. Here’s a zoomed-out view, so you can see how such questions are surrounded by essay text both above and below:

值得注意的是这种互动发生在文章本身的文本中. 下面是一个放大视图, 你可以看到这些问题是如何被文本上下包围的. 

![Screenshot depicting the interactive quiz interleaved in a few paragraphs of prose.](https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/qc_zoom_out-2x.png)

We use the term *cards* for these interface elements pairing questions and answers.

我们把这个包含了问题和相应答案的界面叫做*卡片*. 

Of course, for long-term memory it’s not enough for users to be tested just once on their recall. Instead, a few days after first reading the essay, the user receives an email asking them to sign into a review session. In that review session they’re tested again, in a manner similar to what was shown above. Then, through repeated review sessions in the days and weeks ahead, people consolidate the answers to those questions into their long-term memory.

当然, 为了要形成长期记忆, 只让用户进行一次回忆测试是不够的. 所以在第一次阅读文章的几天后, 用户会收到一封电子邮件, 要求他们登录以进入复习环节. 在复习环节中, 他们会再次接受测试, 测试方式和之前类似. 然后, 通过未来几天和几周的反复复习, 这些答案的长期记忆将会得到巩固. 

So far, this looks like no more than an essay which integrates old-fashioned flashcards. But notice the intervals indicated at the bottom of the cards:

到目前为止, 这看起来不过是一篇集成了老式抽认卡的文章. 但请注意卡片底部标注的间隔：

https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/qc_icons.mp4

https://www.zhihu.com/zvideo/1377724466940706816

The highlighted time interval is the duration until the user is tested again on the question. Questions start out with the time interval “in-text”, meaning the user is being tested as they read the essay. That rises to five days, if the user remembers the answer to the question. The interval then continues to rise upon each successful review, from five days to two weeks, then a month, and so on. After just five successful reviews the interval is at four months. If the user doesn’t remember at any point, the time interval drops down one level, e.g., from two weeks to five days.

高亮出来的时间间隔是用户再次接受问题测试的所需时间. 问题开始出现时的时间间隔是 "文中", 意味着用户在阅读文章的同时就会被测试. 如果用户记住了问题的答案, 这个时间间隔会上升到五天. 随后间隔时间会在每次成功完成复习后继续增加, 从五天到两周, 然后是一个月, 以此类推. 仅需完成五次成功的复习, 间隔时间就达到了四个月. 如果用户在某个时候都不记得了, 时间间隔就会下降一级, 例如从两周变成五天. 

This takes advantage of a fundamental fact about human memory: as we are repeatedly tested on a question, our memory of the answer gets stronger, and we are likely to retain it for longerThe literature on this effect is vast. A useful entrée is: Gwern Branwen, [Spaced Repetition for Efficient Learning](https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition).. This exponential rise perhaps seems innocuous, but it’s transformative. It means that a relatively small number of reviews will enable a user to remember for years. With the time taken to review a typical question being just a few seconds, that means a user can achieve long-term recall with no more than a few minutes’ work. By contrast, with conventional flashcards it takes hours of review to achieve the same durability. Exponential scheduling is far more efficient.

这套方法利用了一个人类记忆的基本事实：当我们被反复测试同一个问题时, 我们对答案的记忆会越来越强[^6], 而且可能会留存更长时间. 这种指数式间隔安排方式看上去没什么了不起, 但这却是革命性的, 这意味着只需相对较少的复习次数就能让用户记住这些内容好几年. 由于一个问题一般只需要几秒钟复习, 这意味着用户只需花几分钟的时间就能实现长期记忆. 相比之下, 传统的抽认卡则需要几个小时的复习才能达到同样的持久性, 指数式间隔安排的效率显然要高得多. 

## The early impact of the prototype mnemonic medium 原型记忆媒介的早期影响

Although it’s early days for *Quantum Country* we can begin to see some of the impact of the mnemonic medium. Plotted below is the demonstrated retention of answers for each user, versus the number of times each question in the mnemonic essay has been reviewed:

尽管量子国度尚处于早期阶段, 但我们已经能看到一些记忆媒介产生的影响. 下图是记忆性文章中所有问题的[证实留存天数]与每个问题的复习次数的散点图. 



![Graph depicting exponentially-rising demonstranted retention](https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/dem_retention-2x.png)

The graph takes a little unpacking to explain. By a card’s “demonstrated retention” we mean the maximum time between a successful review of that card, and the prior review of that card. A little more concretely, consider repetition number 6, say (on the horizontal axis). At the point, a user has reviewed all 112 questions in the essay 6 times. And the vertical axis shows the total demonstrated retention, summed across all cards, with each blue dot representing a single user who has reached repetition 6.

这张图需要稍微解释一下. 上面说的一张问题的证实留存天数是指正确回答该问题与上一次回答该问题之间的最长时间. 具体来说, 考虑一下横轴上的数字6. 在这一点上的用户都已经复习了文章中所有的112张卡片6次. 纵轴显示的是所有卡片的证实留存天数, 每个蓝点代表一个复习了6次的用户. 

So, for instance, after 6 repetitions, we see from the graph that most users are up around 6,000 days of demonstrated retention. That means an average of about 6,000 / 112 ~ 54 days per question in the essay. Intuitively, that seems pretty good – if you’re anything like us, a couple of months after reading something you have only a hazy memory. By contrast, these users have, at low time cost to themselves (of which more below), achieved nearly two months of demonstrated retention across 112 detailed questions.

因此, 举例来说, 经过6次复习, 大多数用户的总证实留存天数达到了6000天左右. 也就是说, 平均一下, 文章中的每个问题都留存了 54天. 直观来看这个效果很好——如果你只是和大多数人一样, 那么在读过一些东西之后的几个月, 你只能留有一个模糊的记忆. 相比之下, 这些用户以较低的时间成本(详见下文), 在112个细节性问题上实现了近两个月的已证实留存. 

Furthermore, you can see the exponential rise in retention with the number of times cards have been reviewed. After the first review, users typically have an average of just over 2 days of demonstrated retention, per cardParticularly careful readers may wonder how this is possible, given that we stated earlier that the first review interval is 5 days. The explanation is that we recently modified the review schedule so the first review is after 5 days. For most of *Quantum Country*’s history the review schedule was more conservative, and this is the reason for the difference.. But by the sixth review that rises to an average of 54 days of demonstrated retention. That typically takes about 95 minutes of total review time to achieve. Given that the essay takes about 4 or so hours to read, this suggests that a less than 50% overhead in time commitment can provide many months or years of retention for almost all the important details in the essay.

此外, 你可以看到留存天数随着卡片的复习次数呈指数上升. 在第一次复习后, 平均每张卡, 用户通常都有超过2天的证实留存天数. [^7]但复习了6次之后, 这个数字就上升到了54天. 把所有卡片复习六次大约共需要85分钟, 考虑到阅读这篇文章需要4个小时左右的时间, 这就表明只需不到50%的时间投入可以把文章中几乎所有的重要细节记住几个月甚至几年. 

This is the big, counterintuitive advantage of spaced repetition: you get exponential returns for increased effort. On average, every extra minute of effort spent in review provides more and more benefit. This is in sharp contrast with most experiences in life, where we run into diminishing returns. For instance, ordinarily if you increase the amount of time you spend reading by 50%, you expect to get no more than 50% extra out of it, and possibly much less. But with the mnemonic medium when you increase the amount of time you spend reading by 50%, you may get 10x as much out of it. Of course, we don’t quite mean those numbers literally. But it does convey the key idea of getting a strongly non-linear return. It’s a change in the quality of the medium.

这就是间隔重复的最大也是最反直觉的优势：持续的努力可以获得指数级的回报. 平均来说, 在复习中每多花一分钟的时间, 就会有越来越多的好处. 这与生活中的大多数情况形成了鲜明对比, 因为生活中我们往往会面临边际递减效应. 比如通常情况下, 即使你多花50%的时间在阅读上, 你也不能指望能得到超过50%额外收益, 甚至可能更少. 但是通过记忆媒介, 当你多花50%的时间, 你可能会得到10倍的收益. 当然, 这些数字不是精确的, 但它确实传达了一种关键理念：获得巨大的非线性回报. 这就是一种媒介质量的变化. 

This delayed benefit makes the mnemonic medium unusual in multiple ways. Another is this: most online media use short-term engagement models, using variations on operant conditioning to drive user behavior. This is done by Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and many other popular media forms. The mnemonic medium is much more like meditation – in some ways, the anti-product, since it violates so much conventional Silicon Valley wisdom – in that the benefits are delayed, and hard to have any immediate sense of. Indeed, with the mnemonic medium, the greater the delay, the more the benefit.

这种延迟回报让记忆媒介在多个方面都不寻常. 另一个不寻常的地方是, 大多数社交软件使用短期交互的模式(short-term engagement models), 用一种类似条件反射的策略来驱使用户. Twitter、Facebook、Instagram和许多其他流行的社交软件都是这样做的. 而记忆媒介在某些方面更像冥想, 是前面提到的那些产品的反面, 因为记忆媒介违反了许多硅谷的传统智慧----在这里好处是延迟的, 而且很难有任何即时的获得感. 事实上, 对于记忆媒介而言, 延迟越大, 受益越多. 

These are preliminary results, and need more investigation. One naturally wonders what would happen if we’d been much more aggressive with the review schedule, setting the initial interval between reviews to (say) 2 months? If users reliably retained information up to that point, then the graph would start very high, and we wouldn’t see the exponential. We need to investigate these and many similar questions to better understand what’s going on with user’s memories.

这些是初步结果, 需要更多的研究. 人们自然会想, 如果我们采用更激进的复习间隔, 比如将复习的初始间隔时间设定为两个月会发生什么? 如果用户能够把记忆可靠地保留到那个时间点, 那么曲线的起点就会很高, 我们就看不到指数增长的趋势了. 还有许多类似的问题需要研究以更好地了解用户的记忆是怎么回事. 

Early feedback from users makes us cautiously optimistic that they’re finding the mnemonic medium useful. In May 2019, one of us posted to Twitter a short thread explaining the technical details of how quantum teleportation works. One user of *Quantum Country* [replied to the thread](https://twitter.com/KeithMansfield/status/1132031824513966080) with:

用户的早期反馈使我们谨慎乐观地认为记忆媒介对他们很有用. 2019年5月, 我们中的一个人在Twitter上发布了一则推文, 解释了量子传送的技术细节. 一位量子国度的用户[回复了该推文](https://twitter.com/KeithMansfield/status/1132031824513966080), 称：

> I’ve only done your first quantum country course (so far) but I find it remarkable that I can view the proof and follow it, knowing what everything means. It’s almost like Neo in The Matrix telling Morpheus, ‘I know quantum computing’In the movie *The Matrix* one of the characters (Neo) uses a computer to very rapidly upload martial arts skills into his mind. As he opens his eyes after completing the upload he tells another character (Morpheus): “I know Kung Fu”..
>
> 到目前我只学完了你们在量子国度上的第一个课程, 但我惊奇的发现我可以follow住这个证明, 知道其中每个部分的含义. 这几乎就像黑客帝国里的Neo对Morpheus说「I know quantum computing」[^8].

A user with significantly more prior experience of quantum computing [wrote](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19429035):

另一位在量子计算领域有着丰富经验的用户这样写到:

> I have a PhD in quantum information/computing and I knew everything in the essay before reading it, but the additional understanding I got from doing the given spaced repetition flashcards significantly improved my understanding of the material. Everyone who is reading this essay, should sign up and give spaced repetition a try.
>
> 我是量子信息/计算方面的博士,在读这篇文章之前我已经知晓文章中的所有内容, 但通过做给定的间隔重复抽认卡, 我获得了了额外的感悟, 这大大提升了我对材料的理解. 每个正在阅读这篇文章的人, 都应该去量子国度注册并尝试一下间隔重复记忆法. 

Another user, new to quantum computing, told us that *Quantum Country* “is by far the best way that I could imagine being introduced to this material”. When we asked how he’d used what he’d learned, he explained that when a visitor to his company gave a technical seminar about quantum computing, he expected to get lost after about 10 minutes. Instead:

另一位刚接触量子计算的用户告诉我们, 量子国度是迄今为止他所能想象的介绍这门学科的最佳方式. 当我们问到他如何学以致用时, 他说, 当他公司的一位来宾举办关于量子计算的技术研讨会时, 他原本预计会在大约10分钟后会迷失方向. 然而: 

> Wow, I actually followed that for 40 or 45 minutes because the matrices looked familiar… [the medium means] you run into concepts over and over again… It affords interactions at a more effective level of abstraction.
>
> 哇, 我实际上follow住了40到45分钟, 因为这些矩阵看上去都很熟悉......(这种媒介的特点决定了)你会一遍又一遍地遇到这些概念......这种媒介提供了一种抽象层面上的高效互动. 

Site analytics show a constant flow of people steadily working through the review sessions in the manner we intended. Six months after release of the prototype, 195 users had demonstrated one full month of retention on at least 80% of cards in the essay, demonstrating an extraordinary level of commitment to the processWe’ve made no attempt at all to scale this out. It’s interesting to ponder doing so.. We don’t yet have a good model of exactly what those people are learning, but it seems plausible they are taking away considerably more than from a conventional essay, or perhaps even from a conventional class.

网站分析显示, 有源源不断的人按照我们预期的方式持续稳定地完成复习周期. 原型发布6个月后, 195名用户对文章中至少80%的卡片都有整整一个月的证实留存天数, 有力地证明了这一过程的有效性.[^9] 我们还没有一个比较好的模型来说明这些人到底学到了什么, 但看上去比从传统的论文甚至是传统的课堂上学到了更多的东西. 

Of course, this kind of feedback and these kinds of results should be taken with a grain of salt. The mnemonic medium is in its early days, has many deficiencies, and needs improvement in many ways (of which more soon). It is, however, encouraging to hear that some users already find the medium exceptionally helpful, and suggests developing and testing the medium further. At a minimum, it seems likely the mnemonic medium is genuinely helping people remember. And furthermore it has the exponentially increasing efficiency described above: the more people study, the more benefit they get per minute studied.

当然, 这些反馈和结果应该谨慎对待. 记忆媒介还处于早期阶段, 有许多不足之处, 并且在许多方面需要改进(很快会有更多的改进). 然而, 令人鼓舞的是, 已经一些用户发现这种媒介非常有用, 并建议我们进一步开发和测试这种媒介. 至少, 这种记忆媒介似乎真的能帮助人们记忆. 此外, 它还具有上述的指数式的增长效率：人们学习得越久, 每学习一分钟能得到的好处就越多. 

In another informal experiment, we tried to figure out how much it affected user’s memories when they *weren’t* asked to review cards. To do this, we introduced a deliberate short (two-week) delay on reviews for a small subset of 8 cards. That is, some users would review those 8 cards upon an initial read, and then would be prevented from reviewing them again for at least two weeks. Other users would continue to study as normal on the 8 cards. By comparing the two groups we could estimate the effect that reviewing the cards had on user’s memories.

在另一个非正式的实验中, 我们试图弄清楚当用户没有复习卡片时, 对他们的记忆有多大影响. 为了做到这一点, 我们特意对其中8张卡片进行了短暂(两周)的延迟复习. 也就是说, 一些用户在初次阅读时会复习这8张卡片, 然后在至少两周内不会再复习. 其他用户则继续正常地复习这8张卡片. 通过比较这两组人, 我们可以估计复习卡片对用户的记忆所产生的影响. 

What happened? Well, for those users whose reviews were delayed, accuracy dropped from 91% (upon the initial read) to 87% (after two weeks). This may seem a small drop, but keep in mind that users continued to review other cards, which almost certainly boosted their final performance, since those other cards had some overlap in content with the delayed cards. It’s difficult to avoid this kind of overlap without delaying reviews on all cards, a more drastic change in user experience than we wanted to impose. For users who were asked to review the cards as normal, accuracy improved from 89% to 96%. The short summary is: when users didn’t review the cards, accuracy dropped by 4%; when they did review the cards, accuracy increased by 7%In more detail: there were 16 users in the group that did the reviews, per usual, and 25 users in the group where reviews were delayed. The 95% confidence intervals were: 91 ± 4%, 87 ± 5%, 89 ± 5%, 96 ± 3%, assuming each variable is binomial, independent and identically distributed. This latter assumption is approximate, since we’d expect some user- and question-dependent effects. Note also that this was done in an earlier version of *Quantum Country*, where the review schedule had intervals of one day, three days, one week, and and two weeks..

发生了什么? 对于那些被推迟复习的用户来说, 准确率从91%(初次阅读时)下降到87%(两周后). 似乎下降的不多, 但别忘了, 这些用户还将正常地复习其他的卡片. 这些卡片的内容难免会与这8张卡片有所重叠, 因此也一定会提到他们的记忆表现. 如果推迟所有卡片的复习, 这种效应是很难避免的, 但要是这样做对用户体验的影响就太大了. 对于那些正常复习卡片的用户, 准确率从89%提高到了96%. 总结一下就是: 用户不复习卡片的话, 准确率就会下降4%; 如果他们按时复习卡片的话, 准确率会提高7%. [^10]

Another way of looking at the data from this informal experiment is to ask which users saw improved or unchanged performance, and which saw their performance get worse. In fact, every single user (100%) who reviewed cards on the regular schedule saw their performance either stay the same or improve. By contrast, 40% of the users whose reviews were delayed saw their performance get worse, while 60% saw it stay the same or improve.

看待这个非正式实验的数据的另一种方式是看哪些用户的记忆表现得到了改善或没有变化, 而哪些用户的表现变得更糟. 事实上, 所有按时复习卡片的用户(100%)的记忆表现都保持不变或有所提高. 相比之下, 40%的被推迟复习的用户的记忆表现出现了下降, 另外60%则维持不变. 

These are small-but-promising results. Of course, our experiment was only done over two weeks, and we’d expect larger effects in experiments done over longer periods. And, as already mentioned, the effect is likely diminished by overlaps between the cards. Nonetheless, this informal experiment again suggests the mnemonic medium is helping people’s memory, and suggests more comprehensive studies.

这组数据虽少却有信度. 当然, 我们只做了两周的实验, 希望能在长周期实验中看到更明显的效果. 并且, 就像上面说的那样, 间隔记忆的效果会被有内容重叠的卡片冲淡. 但无论如何, 这个不正式的实验还是表明了记忆媒介确实在帮助人们进行记忆, 并为更全面的实验指明了方向. 

Despite these suggestive preliminary results, it’s still tempting to be dismissive. Isn’t this “just” an essay with flashcards embedded? At some level, of course, that’s correct. In the same way, wikis are just editable web pages; Twitter is just a way of sharing very short form writing; and Facebook is just a way of sharing writing and pictures with friends. Indeed, writing itself is just a clever way of ordering a small number of symbols on a page. While a medium may be simple, that doesn’t mean it’s not profound. As we shall see, the mnemonic medium has many surprising properties. It turns out that flashcards are dramatically under-appreciated, and it’s possible to go much, much further in developing the mnemonic medium than is *a priori* obvious.

虽然这些初期结果看上去有希望, 但还是有人会不屑一顾: 这*不就是*嵌入了抽认卡的文章吗?  从某种程度上说, 这也对. 要是这么说, 维基百科不过是人人可编辑的网页; Twitter不过是一种分享短文字的方式; Facebook不过是一种向朋友分享篇章和图片的方式. 实际上, 写作本身也不过是把一些符号按一定顺序排列到纸上. 这种媒介或许看上去很简单, 但这并不妨碍它们具有深刻的意义. 正如我们将看到的, 记忆媒介有许多令人惊讶的特性. 事实证明, 抽认卡被大大低估了. 而且在发展记忆媒介方面, 有可能比原先认为的走得更远. 

Before we delve deeper into the mnemonic medium, let’s mention one challenge in the discussion: the inherent difficulty in achieving a good balance between conveying enthusiasm and the kind of arm’s-length skepticism appropriate for evaluation. On the one hand, we would not have built the mnemonic medium if we weren’t excited about the underlying ideas, and wanted to develop those enthusiasms. To explain the mnemonic medium well, we need to bring you, the reader, inside that thinking. But having done that, we also need to step back and think more skeptically about questions such as: is this medium really working? What effect is it actually having on people? Can it be made 10x better? 100x better? Or, contrariwise, are there blockers that make this an irredeemably bad or at best mediocre idea? How important a role does memory play in cognition, anyway? So far, we’ve focused on the enthusiastic case for the medium, why one might consider this design at all. But later in this essay we’ll gradually step back and reflect in a more skeptical frame.

在我们深入研究记忆媒介之前, 让我们提一下在写文章过程中的一个挑战, 即如何在适合传教的那种乐观和适合评估的那种独立的怀疑态度之间取得一个适当的平衡. 一方面, 要是连我们都不为记忆媒介背后的那些想法感到兴奋并保持乐观, 那我们就不可能开发出这种记忆媒介. 所以为了更好地介绍这种记忆媒介, 我们需要把你, 也就是读者, 带到这种思维里. 但是在这样做之后, 我们又需要退一步, 批判性地去思考一些问题, 比如: 这种媒介真的有效吗? 它对人到底有什么影响? 能帮助人们10倍速地去记忆? 甚至是100倍速? 或者, 反过来想, 是否有反对意见让这成为一个无法挽回的坏主意, 或者充其量只是一个平庸的想法? 记忆在认知中到底起着多么重要的作用? 到目前为止, 我们已经关注了这种媒介的乐观部分以及为什么人们会考虑这样设计这一媒介. 但是在接下来的部分中, 我们将逐渐后退, 在一个更加批判性的框架中思考. 

## Expanding the scope of memory systems: what types of understanding can they be used for?

## 扩展记忆系统的使用范围：还可以用于哪些类型的理解？

*Quantum Country* is an example of a *memory system*. That is, it’s a system designed to help users easily consolidate what they’ve learned into long-term memory. It’s part of a long history of memory systems, going back to ancient times, when the orator Cicero and the rhetorician Quintilian described mnemonic techniques that could be used to memorize long texts.

*量子国度*是记忆系统的一个实例. 记忆系统就是一个旨在帮助用户轻松地将他们所学的知识巩固到长期记忆中的系统. 记忆系统的悠久历史可以追溯到古代, 当时的演说家Cicero和修辞家Quintilian描述了一些可以用来记忆长篇文章的记忆技巧.  

In modern times, many memory systems have been developed. Among the better known are Anki, SuperMemo, Quizlet[^11], Duolingo, and Memrise. Like *Quantum Country*, each of these systems uses increasing time intervals between reviews of particular questions. Such systems are sometimes known as *spaced-repetition memory systems* (or *SRM* systems). They’re usually justified in a manner similar to our explanation for *Quantum Country*: some notion of each review gradually increasing the consolidation strength for a memory. 

现代又产生了许多记忆系统. 比较著名的几个是Anki, SuperMemo, Quizlet[^11], 多邻国和Memrise. 和量子国度类似, 这些系统都采用了对每个问题逐渐延长复习间隔的方法. 这种系统有时也被称为*间隔重复记忆系统*(或SRM系统). 这些系统的有效的原因和我们前面对*量子国度*的解释差不多: 每次复习遇到的某些概念会巩固我们的记忆. 

SRM systems are most widely used in language learning. Duolingo, for instance, claims [25 million monthly active users](https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/01/duolingo-hires-its-first-chief-marketing-officer-as-active-user-numbers-stagnate/). Reports are mixed on success. Some serious users are [enthusiastic about their success](https://www.thrillist.com/travel/nation/duolingo-app-review-foreign-language) with Duolingo. But [others find it of limited utility](https://www.thecut.com/2019/01/does-duolingo-even-work.html). The company, of course, [touts research](https://support.duolingo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000035183-Are-there-official-studies-about-Duolingo-) showing that it’s incredibly successful. It seems likely to us that Duolingo and similar systems are useful for many users as part of (but only part of) a serious language learning program.

SRM系统在语言学习中的应用最为广泛. 比如多邻国宣称他们[有2500万的月活](https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/01/duolingo-hires-its-first-chief-marketing-officer-as-active-user-numbers-stagnate/). 而关于成效如何的报道却各执一词. 一些认真的用户[对他们在多邻国上取得的成果非常满意](https://www.thrillist.com/travel/nation/duolingo-app-review-foreign-language), 但[其他人认为效果有限](https://www.thecut.com/2019/01/does-duolingo-even-work.html). 当然, 多邻国自己肯定是[吹捧说研究表明该系统十分成功](https://support.duolingo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000035183-Are-there-official-studies-about-Duolingo-). 在我们看来, 多邻国和其他类似的系统应该可以在一个正式的语言学习计划中起到一定程度(也只能是一定程度)的作用. 

What about memory systems for uses beyond language? Quizlet is popular, with [50 million monthly active users](https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/25/quizlet-hits-50m-monthly-users/). It’s widely used in classrooms, especially for simple declarative knowledge – lists of American Presidents, capitals of countries, and so on. Anki and SuperMemo seem to most often be used for similar simple declarative knowledge, but have much smaller active user bases than QuizletThey are, however, widely used within some interesting niche audiences. For instance, there is a [thriving population](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki/) of medical students using Anki.[^12]

除了语言学习之外的那些记忆系统怎么样呢? Quizlet是一个有着[5000万月活](https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/25/quizlet-hits-50m-monthly-users/)的流行软件. 它在课堂上得到了广泛使用, 特别是用来记忆简单的陈述性知识----美国总统名单, 国家首都等等. Anki和SuperMemo似乎也常用于记忆简单的陈述性知识, 但它们的活跃用户群要比Quizlet小得多. [^12]

One of the ideas motivating *Quantum Country* is that memory systems aren’t just useful for simple declarative knowledge, such as vocabulary words and lists of capitals. In fact, memory systems can be extraordinarily helpful for mastering abstract, conceptual knowledge, the kind of knowledge required to learn subjects such as quantum mechanics and quantum computing. This is achieved in part through many detailed strategies for constructing cards capable of encoding this kind of understanding. But, more importantly, it’s possible because of the way the mnemonic medium embeds spaced repetition inside a narrative. That narrative embedding makes it possible for context and understanding to build in ways difficult in other memory systems.

这就是*量子国度*开发的一个动因: 记忆系统不仅仅对如词汇表和各国首都这种简单的陈述性知识有用, 事实上, 记忆系统对掌握抽象的, 概念性的知识也有极大的帮助, 这种知识恰恰是学习量子力学和量子计算等科目所需要的. 这些内容可以通过许多详细的策略编码成辅助理解的卡片. 不过更重要的是要看到是这种嵌入了间隔重复系统的记忆媒介才使之成为了可能. 这种嵌入使得文章和卡片可以用其他记忆系统难以想象的方式编写. 

Other people have also developed ways of using memory systems for abstract, conceptual knowledge. Perhaps most prominently, the creator of the SuperMemo system, Piotr Wozniak, has [written extensively](http://supermemopedia.com/wiki/Main_Page) about the many ingenious ways he uses memory systems[^13]. And several other expert users of memory systems have also developed similar strategies. However, employing those strategies requires considerable skill. In practice, that skill barrier has meant these strategies are used by no more than a tiny handful of people.

其他一些人也研究出了一些把记忆系统用于抽象的概念性知识的方法. 最突出的是或许当属SuperMemo的创造者Piotr Wozniak. 他[写了很多文章](http://supermemopedia.com/wiki/Main_Page)来介绍了他使用记忆系统的巧妙方法[^13]. 其他一些记忆系统的专家级用户也发明了类似的策略. 然而, 应用这些策略需要相当的技巧. 在实践中, 这种技巧上的障碍意味着这些策略只能被极少数人使用. 

By contrast, in *Quantum Country* an expert writes the cards, an expert who is skilled not only in the subject matter of the essay, but also in strategies which can be used to encode abstract, conceptual knowledge. And so *Quantum Country* provides a much more scalable approach to using memory systems to do abstract, conceptual learning. In some sense, *Quantum Country* aims to expand the range of subjects users can comprehend at all. In that, it has very different aspirations to all prior memory systems.

相比之下, 在*量子国度*中, 一位既精通文章主题又能熟练运用上述策略的专家直接写好了卡片. 因此, *量子国度*为使用记忆系统来进行抽象的, 概念性的学习提供了一种可扩展性更好的方法. 在某种意义上, *量子国度*的目的是拓展用户能够理解的主题范围. 在这一点上，它所希望达成的愿景与之前所有的记忆系统都很不同. 

More generally, we believe memory systems are a far richer space than has previously been realized. Existing memory systems barely scratch the surface of what is possible. We’ve taken to thinking of *Quantum Country* as a *memory laboratory*. That is, it’s a system which can be used both to better understand how memory works, and also to develop new kinds of memory system. We’d like to answer questions such as:

更广泛地说, 我们认为记忆系统的探索空间远比我们以前意识到要丰富得多. 现有的系统几乎都还没有触及到可能性的边界. 我们已经把*量子国度*看作是一个*记忆研究实验室*. 也就是说, 这个系统既可以用来更好地理解记忆的工作原理, 也可以用来开发新类型的记忆系统. 我们想要回答这样的问题: 

- What are new ways memory systems can be applied, beyond the simple, declarative knowledge of past systems?
- How deep can the understanding developed through a memory system be? What patterns will help users deepen their understanding as much as possible?
- How far can we raise the human capacity for memory? And with how much ease? What are the benefits and drawbacks?
- Might it be that one day most human beings will have a regular *memory practice*, as part of their everyday lives? Can we make it so memory becomes a choice; is it possible to in some sense solve the problem of memory?
  
- 除了像过去那样用来记忆简单的, 陈述性的知识, 记忆系统还可以有哪些新的应用方式? 
- 通过记忆系统形成的理解能有多深? 哪些方法能帮助用户尽可能地加深理解? 
- 我们能在多大程度上提高人类的记忆能力? 达成的难度有多大? 又有什么好处和坏处？
- 是否有一天，大多数人都会把定期的*记忆练习*作为他们日常生活中的一部分? 我们能不能让记忆成为一种选择? 我们有没有可能在某种意义上彻底解决记忆的问题? 

Over the next few sections we sketch out some of our thinking about how memory systems may be developed. We’ll see that memory systems are a small part of a much bigger picture. Not only is seriously developing memory systems likely to lead to one or more transformative tools for thought, we also believe it will teach us much about the general problem of developing such tools.

在接下来的几节中, 我们将勾勒出我们对如何开发记忆系统的一些思考. 我们将看到, 记忆系统只是一个更大的图景中的一个小部分. 严肃地去开发记忆系统不仅可能促成一种或多种变革性思想工具的产生, 我们相信它还将教会我们许多关于开发这种工具的一般性问题. 

## Improving the mnemonic medium: making better cards

## 改进记忆媒介：编写更好的卡片

In writing mnemonic essays, it’s tempting to treat the content of the cards rather casually. After all, a card is just a question and an answer, each containing a little text, perhaps a figure. Surely they ought to be easy to write?

在写与记忆相关的文章时，卡片的内容很容易被轻视。毕竟，卡片只是一个问题加上一个答案，它们都包含一些文字，也可能是一张图片。当然，编写这些内容应该很容易？

While thinking in this way is tempting, it’s a mistake. In fact, cards are fundamental building blocks of the mnemonic medium, and card-writing is better thought of as an open-ended skill. Do it poorly, and the mnemonic medium works poorly. Do it superbly well, and the mnemonic medium can work very well indeed. By developing the card-writing skill it’s possible to expand the possibilities of the medium.

虽然这种想法很诱人，但这错误的。事实上，卡片是记忆媒介的基石，而编写卡片则被认为是一种开放式的技能。如果写得不好，记忆媒介的效果就会很差。如果写得很好，记忆媒介的效果就会非常好。通过发展编写卡片的技能，我们可能可以扩大这种媒介的可能性。

A helpful comparison is to the sentence in written prose. For the beginning writer it’s tempting to treat sentences casually. But in the hands of a great writer – say, a Nabokov – sentences can be developed into a virtuoso artform. What would it take to achieve virtuoso skill in writing the cards of the mnemonic medium?

一个有用的类比是书面散文中的句子。对于初学写作的人来说，句子很容易被轻视。但是在一个伟大的作家手中--比如说，纳博科夫--句子可以发展成一种精湛的艺术形式。怎样才能获得编写卡片的高超技巧？

It’s not obvious *a priori* that writing cards is such a rich activity. One of us wrote 17,000- and 6,000-word essays[^14] whose subject was in large part understanding how to write good cards. He didn’t realize that was going to be the subject when he began writing; it only became clear in retrospect how rich card writing is. It turns out that answering the question “how to write good cards?” requires thinking hard about your theory of knowledge and how to represent it, and your theory of learning. The better those theories, the better your cards will be. Small wonder it’s a rich, open-ended problem!

*先前*他们很难想象做卡片有那么多门道。我们其中一人写了 17000 字和 6000 字的文章[^14] ，其主题在很大程度上是了解如何编写好卡片。他在开始写作时并没有意识到这将是他的主题；只是在回想时才明白，编写卡片的内容是多么丰富。事实证明，回答 "如何编写好卡片 "这个问题需要认真思考你的知识理论，如何表示它，以及你的学习理论。这些理论越好，你的卡片就越好。难怪这是一个丰富的、开放的问题！

All that said, let’s make a few concrete observations about good card-writing. While the specific examples that follow are relatively banal, they should give you some feeling for the profound issues that arise in improving the mnemonic medium. We’ll begin with three principles we used when writing the cards in *Quantum Country*. Note that these are just three of many more principles – a more detailed discussion of good principles of card construction may be found in [Augmenting Long-term Memory](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html).

说了这么多，让我们对好卡片的编写做一些具体的观察。虽然下面的具体例子比较平淡，但它们应该能让你对改进记忆媒介时出现的深刻问题有一些感觉。我们将从我们在《量子国度》中编写卡片时使用的三个原则开始。请注意，这只是许多原则中的三个——关于构建卡片的良好原则的细节讨论可以在[增强长期记忆](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html)中找到。

- **Most questions and answers should be atomic:** Early in his own personal memory practice, one of us was learning the Unix command to create links in the filesystem. He entered the following question into his memory system: “How to create a soft link from linkname to filename”. Together with the corresponding answer “ln -s filename linkname”. This looks like a good question, but he routinely forgot the answer. To address this, he refactored the card into two more atomic cards. One card: “What’s the basic command and option to create a soft link?” (A: “ln -s”). Second card: “When creating a soft link, in what order do linkname and filename go?” (A: “filename linkname”). Breaking the card into more atomic pieces turned a question he routinely got wrong into two questions he routinely got right. It seemed that the more atomic questions brought more sharply into focus what he was forgetting, and so provided a better tool for improving memory. And what of the original card? Initially, he deleted it. But he eventually added the card back, with the same question and answer, since it served to integrate the understanding in the more atomic cards.
- **大多数问题和答案应该是原子性的：** 在个人记忆实践早期，我们中有人正在学习 Unix 命令，为了在文件系统中创建链接。他在他的记忆系统中输入了以下问题："如何创建一个从链接名到文件名的软链接？"连同相应的答案 "ln -s filename linkname"。这看起来是个好问题，但他经常会忘记答案。为了解决这个问题，他把这张卡片重构为两张更加原子化的卡片。第一张卡片："创建一个软链接的基本命令和选项是什么？" (答："ln -s")。第二张卡片："当创建一个软链接时，linkname 和 filename 按什么顺序排列？" (答："filename linkname")。把卡片分成更多的原子卡片，把一个他经常做错的问题变成了两个他经常做对的问题。看来，更多的原子问题使他更清楚地认识到他所忘记的东西，因此提供了一个更好的工具来改善记忆。那么原来的卡片呢？起初，他把它删除了。但他最终又把这张卡片加了回去，问题和答案都是一样的，因为这张卡有助于整合更多原子卡片中的理解。
- **Make sure the early questions in a mnemonic essay are trivial: it helps many users realize they aren’t paying enough attention as they read:[^15]** This was a discovery made when we released the first *Quantum Country* essay. Anticipating that users would be struggling with a new interface, we deliberately made the first few questions in the essay utterly trivial – sort of a quantum equivalent to “2+2 = ?” – so they could focus on the interface. To our surprise, users performed poorly on these questions, worse than they did on the (much harder) later questions. Our current hypothesis to explain this is that when users failed to answer the first few questions correctly it served as a wakeup call. The questions were so transparently simple that they realized they hadn’t really been paying attention as they read, and so were subsequently more careful.
- **确保助记文章中的前几个问题是琐碎的：这有助于许多用户在阅读时意识到他们没有足够的注意力：[^15]** 这是我们发布第一篇*量子国度*论文时的发现。预计用户会在新的界面上挣扎，我们故意把文章中的前几个问题弄得非常琐碎--有点像 "2+2=？"的量子化。- 这样他们就可以把注意力放在界面上。令我们惊讶的是，用户在这些问题上的表现很差，比他们在后面的问题(更难)上的表现还要差。我们目前的假设是，当用户未能正确回答前几个问题时，这就像一个警钟。这些问题是如此的简单，以至于他们意识到他们在阅读时并没有真正注意到，所以后来就更加小心了。
- **Avoid orphan cards:** These are cards which don’t connect closely to anything else. Suppose, for the sake of illustration, that you’re trying to learn about African geography, and have a question: “What’s the territory in Africa that Morocco disputes?” (A: “The Western Sahara”) If you don’t know anything about the Western Sahara or Morocco or why there’s a dispute, that question will be an orphan, disconnected from everything else. Ideally, you’ll have a densely interconnected web of questions and answers, everything interwoven in striking ways.
- **避免使用孤立卡片：** 这些卡片与其他东西没有密切联系。为了说明问题，假设你正在努力学习非洲地理，并有一个问题："摩洛哥在非洲有争议的领土是什么？" (答："西撒哈拉")。如果你对西撒哈拉或摩洛哥一无所知，也不知道为什么会有争端，那么这个问题就会成为一个孤岛，与其他东西脱节。理想情况下，你会有一个由问题和答案组成的密集的相互联系的网络，一切都以惊人的方式交织在一起。

Ultimately, we’d like to distill out a set of useful practical principles and idioms to help write good cards and, more generally, good mnemonic essays. Aspirationally, such a set of principles and idioms would work much like *The Elements of Style* (or some similar book of prose advice), and would help other people learn to write high-quality mnemonic essays.

最终，我们希望能提炼出一套有用的实用原则和习语，以帮助编写出好的卡片，更广泛地说，好的助记文章。从理想的角度看，这样一套原则、习语和*《风格要素》*(或一些类似的散文建议书)的作用很像，并能帮助其他人学会写出高质量的助记文章。

When we first described *Quantum Country* above we explained it using a simple model of spaced repetition: increased consolidation strength for memories leading to increased time intervals between reviews. This is a helpful simple model, but risks creating the misleading impression that it’s all that’s going on in the system. In fact, for the mnemonic medium to work effectively, spaced repetition must be deployed in concert with many other ideas. The three ideas we just described – atomicity of questions and answers, making early questions trivial, avoiding orphan cards – are just three of dozens of important ideas used in the mnemonic medium. We won’t enumerate all those other ideas here – that’s not the purpose of this essay. But we want to emphasize this point, since it’s common for people to have the simplistic model “good memory system = spaced repetition”. That’s false, and an actively unhelpful way of thinking.

当我们在上面第一次描述*量子国度*时，我们用一个简单的间隔重复模型来解释它：记忆的巩固强度增加导致复习的时间间隔延长。这是一个很有帮助的简单模型，但有可能造成误导性的印象，以为这就是系统中发生的所有事情。事实上，为了使记忆媒介有效地发挥作用，间隔重复必须与其他许多想法共同使用。我们刚才描述的三个想法——问题和答案的原子性、使前几个问题变得琐碎、避免孤立卡片——只是记忆媒介中使用的几十个重要想法中的三个。我们不会在这里列举所有这些其他的想法——这不是这篇文章的目的。但我们想强调这一点，因为人们普遍有一个简单的模式 "好的记忆系统=间隔重复"。这是错误的，而且是一种非常无益的思维方式。

Indeed, thinking in this way is one reason spaced-repetition memory systems often fail for individuals. We often meet people who say “Oh, I thought spaced repetition sounded great, and I tried Anki [*etc*], but it doesn’t work for me”. Dig down a little, and it turns out the person is using their memory system in a way guaranteed to fail. They’ll be writing terrible questions, or using it to learn a subject they don’t care about, or making some other error. They’re a little like a person who thinks “learning the guitar sounds great”, picks it up for half an hour, and then puts it down, saying that they sound terrible and therefore it’s a bad instrument. Of course, what’s really going on is that the guitar and memory systems are both skills that take time to develop. But, with that said, we want to build as much support as possible into the medium. Ideally, even novices would benefit tremendously from the mnemonic medium. That means building in many ideas that go beyond the simplistic model of spaced repetition.

事实上，以这种方式思考是间隔重复记忆系统对个人来说经常不起作用的原因之一。我们经常遇到这样的人："哦，我觉得间隔重复听起来不错，我试过 Anki[*等*]，但它对我不起作用"。稍微深入了解一下，就会发现这个人是以一种必然失败的方式使用他们的记忆系统。他们会写一些糟糕的问题，或者用它来学习一个他们不关心的主题，或者犯一些其他错误。他们有点像一个认为 "学吉他听起来很好 "的人，拿起吉他弹了半个小时，然后就放下了，说自己弹奏的声音很糟糕，因此吉他是一种糟糕的乐器。当然，真正的情况是，吉他和记忆系统都是需要时间来发展的技能。但是，说到这里，我们想在媒介中建立尽可能多的支持。理想情况下，即使是新手也能从记忆媒介中获得巨大的好处。这意味着要在许多想法中建立超越简单的间隔重复模式。

One of us has previously asserted[^16] that in spaced-repetition memory systems, users need to make their own cards. The reasoning is informal: users often report dissatisfaction and poor results when working with cards made by others. The reason seems to be that making the cards is itself an important act of understanding, and helps with committing material to memory. When users work with cards made by others, they lose those benefits.

我们中的一个人以前曾断言[^16]在间隔重复记忆系统中，用户需要自己编写卡片。推理是非正式的：用户经常报告说在使用别人编写的卡片时不满意，效果不好。原因似乎是，编写卡片本身就是一种重要的理解行为，并有助于将材料刻入记忆。当用户使用他人编写的卡片时，他们就失去了这些好处。

*Quantum Country* violates this principle, since users are not making the cards. This violation was a major concern when we began working on *Quantum Country*. However, preliminary user feedback suggests it has worked out adequately. A possible explanation is that, as noted above, making good cards is a difficult skill to master, and so what users lose by not making their own cards is made up by using what are likely to be much higher-quality cards than they could have made on their own. In future, it’s worth digging deeper into this issue, both to understand it beyond informal models, and to explore ways of getting the benefits of active card making.

*量子国度*违反了这一原则，因为用户并没有编写卡片。当我们开始开发*量子国度*时，这一违反是我们主要的担忧。然而，初步的用户反馈表明，它的效果是充分的。一个可能的解释是，如上所述，编写好的卡片是一种难以掌握的技能，因此用户因不编写自己的卡片而失去的东西，可以通过使用可能比他们自己编写得更高质量的卡片来弥补。在未来，我们应该更深入地研究这个问题，既要超越非正式模型来了解它，又要探索如何获得主动编写卡片的好处。

Above we discussed three principles of good question-and-answer construction. Of course, it’s also possible to make more structural modifications to the nature of the cards themselves. Here’s three questions suggesting experiments in this vein:

上面我们讨论了好的问答结构的三个原则。当然，也可以对卡片本身的性质进行更多的结构性修改。这里有三个问题，建议在这些方向上进行实验：

- **How can we ensure users don’t just learn surface features of questions?** One question in *Quantum Country* asks: “Who has made progress on using quantum computers to simulate quantum field theory?” with the answer: “John Preskill and his collaborators”. This is the only “Who…?” question in the entire essay, and many users quickly learn to recognize it from just the “Who…?” pattern, and parrot the answer without engaging deeply with the question. This is a common failure mode in memory systems, and it’s deadly to understanding. One response, which we plan to trial soon, is to present the question in multiple different-but-equivalent forms. So the user first sees the question as “Who has made progress [*etc*]?”; but then the second time the question is presented as a fill-in-the-blanks: “___ and his collaborators have made progress on using quantum computers to simulate quantum field theory.” And so on, multiple different forms of the question, designed so the user must always engage deeply with the meaning of the question, not its superficial appearance. Ultimately, we’d like to develop a library of techniques for identifying when this learning-the-surface-feature pattern is occurring, and for remedying it.
- **我们如何确保用户不只是学习问题的表面特征？**《量子国度》中的一个问题问道："谁在使用量子计算机模拟量子场理论方面取得了进展？"，答案是："John Preskill 和他的合作者"。这是整篇文章中唯一一个以"谁"开头的问题，许多用户很快就学会了只从 "谁...... "的模式中识别出来，并鹦鹉学舌地说出了答案，而没有深入参与这个问题。这是记忆系统中一个常见的失败模式，对理解是致命的。我们计划很快进行试验的一个对策是，以多种形式不同但本质相同的表述呈现问题。因此，用户第一次看到的问题是 "谁取得了[*等*]的进展？"；但第二次看到的问题是以填空的方式呈现。"___和他的合作者在使用量子计算机模拟量子场理论方面取得了进展。" 以此类推，问题的多种不同形式，旨在让用户必须始终深入参与问题的含义，而不是其表面的外观。最终，我们希望开发一个技术库，用于识别这种学习表面特征的模式何时发生，并对其进行补救。
- **How to best help users when they forget the answer to a question?** Suppose a user can’t remember the answer to the question: “Who was the second President of the United States?” Perhaps they think it’s Thomas Jefferson, and are surprised to learn it’s John Adams. In a typical spaced-repetition memory system this would be dealt with by decreasing the time interval until the question is reviewed again. But it may be more effective to follow up with questions designed to help the user understand some of the surrounding context. E.g.: “Who was George Washington’s Vice President?” (A: “John Adams”). Indeed, there could be a whole series of followup questions, all designed to help better encode the answer to the initial question in memory.
- **当用户忘记问题的答案时，如何最好地帮助他们？** 假设一个用户不记得这个问题的答案："谁是美国的第二任总统？" 也许他们认为是托马斯-杰斐逊，而当得知是约翰-亚当斯时，他们很惊讶。在一个典型的间隔重复记忆系统中，这种情况可以通过缩短再次复习该问题的时间间隔来解决。但是，用旨在帮助用户理解一些相关背景的问题来跟进可能会更有效。例如："谁是乔治-华盛顿的副总统？" (答："约翰-亚当斯")。事实上，可以有一整个系列的后续问题，都是为了帮助更好地在记忆中编码最初问题的答案。
- **How to encode stories in the mnemonic medium?** People often find certain ideas most compelling in story form. Here’s a short, fun example: did you know that Steve Jobs actively opposed the development of the App Store in the early days of the iPhone? It was instead championed by another executive at Apple, Scott Forstall. Such a story carries a force not carried by declarative facts alone. It’s one thing to know in the abstract that even the visionaries behind new technologies often fail to see many of their uses. It’s quite another to hear of Steve Jobs arguing with Scott Forstall against what is today a major use of a technology Jobs is credited with inventing. Can the mnemonic medium be used to help people internalize such stories? To do so would likely violate the principle of atomicity, since good stories are rarely atomic (though this particular example comes close). Nonetheless, the benefits of such stories seem well worth violating atomicity, if they can be encoded in the cards effectively.
- **如何在记忆媒介中对故事进行编码？** 人们常常发现某些想法在故事形式中最有说服力。这里有一个简短而有趣的例子：你知道吗，在iPhone的早期，史蒂夫-乔布斯积极反对开发应用程序商店？相反，它是由苹果公司的另一位高管 Scott Forstall 倡导的。这样的故事具有陈述性事实所不具备的力量。抽象地知道，即使是新技术背后的远见卓识者也常常看不到它们的许多用途，这是一回事。听到史蒂夫-乔布斯与斯科特-福斯特尔(Scott Forstall)争论，反对乔布斯所发明的技术在今天的主要用途，则是另一回事。记忆媒介可以用来帮助人们内化这些故事吗？这样做可能会违反原子性原则，因为好的故事很少是原子性的(虽然这个特殊的例子很接近)。尽管如此，如果这些故事能够有效地在卡片上编码，那么这些故事的好处似乎很值得违反原子性原则。

It’s easy to generate dozens more questions and ideas in a similar vein. The mnemonic medium is not a fixed form, but rather a platform for experimentation and continued improvement.

很容易再产生几十个类似的问题和想法。记忆媒介不是一个固定的形式，而是一个实验和持续改进的平台。

One useful metaphor for thinking about how to improve the mnemonic medium is to think of each mnemonic essay as a conventional essay accompanied by a kind of “reflected essay” – the knowledge encoded by all the cards. A user can, with ease, choose to remember as much of that reflected essay as they wish. Of course, the reflection is imperfect. But by developing good card-making strategies we can make the reflected essay a nearly faithful reflection of all the important ideas, the ideas a reader would ideally like to retain.

思考如何改进记忆媒介的一个有用的比喻是，把每篇助记文章看作是一篇传统文章伴随着一种 "反映文章"--由所有卡片编码的知识。用户可以轻松地选择记住他们所希望的那篇反映文章的内容。当然，这种反思是不完美的。但是，通过制定良好的卡片编写策略，我们可以使反映文章几乎忠实地反映出所有重要的观点，也就是读者最想保留的观点。

We said above that it’s a mistake to use the simplistic model “good memory system = spaced repetition”. In fact, while spaced repetition is a helpful way to introduce *Quantum Country*, we certainly shouldn’t pigeonhole the mnemonic medium inside the paradigm of existing SRM systems. Instead, it’s better to go back to first principles, and to ask questions like: what would make *Quantum Country* a good memory system? Are there other powerful principles about memory which we could we build into the system, apart from spaced repetition?

我们在上面说过，使用 "好的记忆系统=间隔重复" 的简单化模式是一个错误。事实上，虽然间隔重复是介绍*量子国度*的一个有用的方法，但我们当然不应该把记忆媒介放进现有的 SRM 系统的范式里。相反，最好是回到第一原则，并提出这样的问题：什么会使*量子国度*成为一个好的记忆系统？除了间隔重复之外，是否还有其他关于记忆的强有力的原则，我们可以将其纳入系统？

In fact, there are ideas about memory very different from spaced repetition, but of comparable power. One such idea is *elaborative encoding*. Roughly speaking, this is the idea that the richer the associations we have to a concept, the better we will remember it. As a consequence, we can improve our memory by enriching that network of associations.

事实上，有一些关于记忆的想法与间隔重复非常不同，但具有相当的力量。其中一个想法是*精细编码*。粗略的说，这是一个想法，即我们对一个概念的联想越丰富，我们就越能记住它。因此，我们可以通过丰富的联系网络来改善我们的记忆。

This is in some sense an obvious idea, according well with everyday experience. For instance, it’s part of the reason it’s so much easier to learn new facts in an area we’re already expert in – we quickly form associations to our existing knowledge. But just because the idea is obvious, that doesn’t mean it’s particularly well supported by existing media forms. There’s a lot of low-hanging fruit which we can actively support inside the mnemonic medium. Indeed, several of the suggestions above already implicitly build on the idea of elaborative encoding – principles like “avoid orphan cards” are based on this. Here’s three more suggestions which build on elaborative encoding:

从某种意义上说，这是一个显而易见的想法，与日常经验很吻合。例如，这也是在我们已经是专家的领域里学习新的事实要容易得多的部分原因--我们很快就会对我们现有的知识形成联系。但是，仅仅因为这个想法是显而易见的，这并不意味着它得到了现有媒介形式的特别支持。有很多低垂的果实，我们可以在记忆媒介里面积极支持。事实上，上面的一些建议已经隐含了精心编码的理念——像 "避免孤立卡片" 这样的原则就是基于此。这里还有三条建议是建立在精细编码之上的：

- **Provide questions and answers in multiple forms:** In 1971, the psychologist Allan Paivio proposed the dual-coding theory, namely, the assertion that verbal and non-verbal information are stored separately in long-term memory. Paivio and others investigated the *picture superiority effect*, demonstrating that pictures and words together are often recalled substantially better than words alone. This suggests, for instance, that the question “Who was George Washington’s Vice President?” may have a higher recall rate if accompanied by a picture of Washington, or if the answer (John Adams) is accompanied by a picture of Adams. For memory systems the dual-coding theory and picture superiority effect suggest many questions and ideas. How much benefit is there in presenting questions and answer in multiple forms? Perhaps even with multiple pictures, or in audio or video (perhaps with multiple speakers of different genders, different accents, *etc*), or in computer code? Perhaps in a form that demands some form of interaction? And in each case: what works best?
- **以多种形式提供问题和答案：** 1971 年，心理学家艾伦-派维奥提出了双重编码理论，即主张语言和非语言信息分别储存在长期记忆中。帕维奥和其他人研究了*图片优势效应*，证明图片和文字在一起的记忆往往比单独的文字要好很多。这表明，例如，"谁是乔治-华盛顿的副总统？"这个问题如果伴随着华盛顿的图片，或者如果答案(约翰-亚当斯)伴随着亚当斯的图片，可能会有更高的回忆率。对于记忆系统来说，双重编码理论和图片优势效应提出了许多问题和想法。以多种形式呈现问题和答案的好处有多大？也许甚至用多种图片，或用音频或视频(也许用不同性别、不同口音的多个发言人，*等等*)，或用计算机代码？也许以一种需要某种形式的互动的形式？而在每一种情况下：什么是最有效的？
- **Vary the context:** In 1978, the psychologists Steven Smith, Arthur Glenberg, and Robert Bjork[^17] reported several experiments studying the effect of place on human memory. In one of their experiments, they found that studying material in two different places, instead of twice in the same place, provided a 40% improvement in later recall. This is part of a broader pattern of experiments showing that varying the context of review promotes memory. We can use memory systems to support things like: changing the location of review; changing the time of day of review; changing the background sound, or lack thereof, while reviewing. In each case, experiments have been done suggesting an impact on recall. It’s not necessarily clear how robust the results are, or how reproducible – it’s possible some (or all) are the results of other effects, uncontrolled in the original experiment. Still, it seems worth building systems to test and (if possible) improve on these results.
- **改变背景：** 1978 年，心理学家史蒂文-史密斯、阿瑟-格伦伯格和罗伯特-比约克[^17] 报告了几个研究地点对人类记忆影响的实验。在其中一个实验中，他们发现在两个不同的地方学习材料，而不是在同一个地方学习两次，可以使后来的回忆提高 40%。这是一个更广泛的实验模式的一部分，显示不同的复习环境会促进记忆。我们可以使用记忆系统来支持以下事情：改变复习的地点；改变复习的时间；改变复习时的背景声音，或者没有背景声音。在每一种情况下，都有实验表明对回忆有影响。不一定清楚这些结果有多强大，或有多大的可重复性--可能有些(或全部)是其他影响的结果，在最初的实验中没有被控制。不过，似乎还是值得建立系统来测试和(如果可能的话)改进这些结果。
- **How do the cards interact with one another? What is the ideal network structure of knowledge?** This is a very complicated and somewhat subtle set of questions. Let’s give a simple example to illustrate the idea. We’ve presented the cards in the mnemonic medium as though they are standalone entities. But there are connections between the cards. Suppose you have cards: “Who was George Washington’s Vice President?” (Answer: “John Adams”, with a picture of Adams); “What did John Adams look like?” (Answer: a picture of Adams); perhaps a question involving a sketch of Adams and Washington together at some key moment; and so on. Now, this set of cards forms a network of interrelated cards. And you can use a memory system like *Quantum Country* to study that network. What happens to people’s observed recall if you remove a card? Are there crucial lynchpin cards? Are there particularly effective network structures? Particularly effective types of relationship between cards? Crucially: are there general principles we can identify about finding the deepest, most powerful ways of representing knowledge in this system?
- **卡片之间是如何互动的？理想的知识网络结构是什么？** 这是一组非常复杂且有些微妙的问题。让我们举一个简单的例子来说明这个想法。我们在记忆媒介中展示的卡片，好像它们是独立的实体。但这些卡片之间是有联系的。假设你有一些卡片。"谁是乔治-华盛顿的副总统？" (答："约翰-亚当斯"，并附有亚当斯的照片)；"约翰-亚当斯长什么样子？" (答：亚当斯的照片)；也许还有一个问题涉及亚当斯和华盛顿在某个关键时刻的素描；等等。现在，这套卡片形成了一个相互关联的卡片网络。而你可以使用像*量子国度*这样的记忆系统来研究这个网络。如果你去掉一张卡片，人们的观察回忆会发生什么变化？是否有关键的林肯牌？是否有特别有效的网络结构？卡片之间有特别有效的关系类型吗？最重要的是：对于在这个系统中寻找最深层、最强大的知识表达方式，我们是否有一般的原则可以确定？

By now it’s obvious that the prototype mnemonic medium we’ve developed is the tip of a much larger iceberg. What’s more, the suggestions we’ve made and questions we’ve asked here are also merely a beginning, to give you the flavor of what is possible.

现在很明显，我们所开发的记忆媒介原型是一个更大冰山的一角。更重要的是，我们在这里提出的建议和问题也仅仅是一个开始，让你感受到什么是可能的。

## Two cheers for mnemonic techniques

## 为记忆技巧欢呼两声

When we discuss memory systems with people, many immediately respond that we should look into mnemonic techniques. This is an approach to memory systems very different to *Quantum Country*, Duolingo, Anki, and the other systems we’ve discussed. You’re perhaps familiar with simple mnemonic techniques from school. One common form is tricks such as remembering the colors of the rainbow as the name Roy G. Biv (red, orange, yellow, green, *etc*). Or remembering the periodic table of elements using a [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgVQKCcfwnU)[^18].

当我们与人讨论记忆系统时，许多人立即回应说我们应该研究记忆技巧。这是一种与*Quantum Country*、Duolingo、Anki以及我们讨论过的其他系统非常不同的记忆系统方法。你也许对学校里的简单记忆技巧很熟悉。一种常见的形式是把彩虹的颜色记成 Roy G. Biv (red, orange, yellow, green, *etc*))。或者用[歌曲](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgVQKCcfwnU)[^18]来记住元素周期表。

A more complex variation is visualization techniques such as the *method of loci*. Suppose you want to remember your shopping list. To do so using the method of loci, you visualize yourself in some familiar location – say, your childhood home. And then you visualize yourself walking from room to room, placing an item from your shopping list prominently in each room. When you go shopping, you can recall the list by imagining yourself walking through the house – your so-called *memory palace* – and looking at the items in each room.

一个更复杂的变体是可视化技巧，如*位置法*。假设你想记住你的购物清单。为了使用位置法，你可以想象自己在某个熟悉的地方--比如说，你童年的家。然后你想象自己从一个房间走到另一个房间，把购物清单上的一件东西放在每个房间的显眼位置。当你去购物时，你可以通过想象自己走过房子--你可以称之为*记忆宫殿*--并看着每个房间里的物品来回忆清单。

If you’ve never used memory palaces this sounds like it couldn’t possibly work. But even novices are often shocked by how well such techniques work, with just a small amount of practice. Experts who work hard developing these techniques can do remarkable things, like memorizing the order of a shuffled deck of cards, or lists of hundreds of digits. It’s a way of using people’s immensely powerful visual and spatial memories as a form of leverage for other types of memory[^19].

如果你从未使用过记忆宫殿，这听起来似乎不可能奏效。但是，即使是新手也常常被这种技巧的效果所震惊，只需要少量的练习。努力开发这些技巧的专家可以做一些了不起的事情，比如记住一副洗好的扑克牌的顺序，或数百个数字的列表。这是一种利用人们无比强大的视觉和空间记忆作为其他类型记忆的杠杆的方式。

Given all this, it’s perhaps not surprising that we often meet people who tell us that mnemonic techniques are a much more promising approach to memory than ideas such as spaced repetition.

鉴于这一切，我们经常遇到一些人告诉我们，记忆技巧是一种比间隔重复等想法更有前途的记忆方法，这也许并不奇怪。

We’re enthusiastic about such mnemonic techniques. But it’s important to understand their limitations, and not be bedazzled by the impressiveness of someone who can rapidly memorize a deck of cards.

我们对这种记忆技巧充满热情。但重要的是要了解它们的局限性，不要被那些能迅速记住一副扑克牌的人的威力所迷惑。

One caution concerns the range of what can be memorized using mnemonic techniques. In practice they’re often quite specialized. Mnemonic experts will, for instance, use somewhat different approaches to memorize lists of digits versus decks of cards. Those approaches must be mastered separately – a heavy time investment for two narrow kinds of memory. Furthermore, the mnemonic techniques tend to be much better suited for concrete objects than abstract conceptual knowledge – it’s difficult to store, say, the main points in the Treaty of Versailles in your memory palace. This doesn’t mean it can’t be done – mnemonic experts have developed clever techniques for converting abstract conceptual knowledge into concrete objects which can be stored in a memory palace. But, in general, an advantage of spaced repetition is that it works across a far broader range of knowledge than do any of the mnemonic techniques.

有一点需要注意的是，使用记忆技巧可以记忆的内容范围。在实践中，它们往往是相当专业的。例如，记忆专家会使用不同的方法来记忆数字列表和扑克牌。这些方法必须分别掌握--对于两种狭义的记忆来说，这是一项沉重的时间投资。此外，记忆技巧往往更适合于具体的物体，而不是抽象的概念性知识--比如说，你很难将《凡尔赛条约》的主要内容储存在你的记忆宫殿中。这并不意味着不能这样做--记忆学专家已经开发出了巧妙的技巧，将抽象的概念性知识转化为可以储存在记忆宫殿的具体对象。但是，一般来说，间隔重复的优势在于，它比任何一种记忆技巧都能在更广泛的知识领域发挥作用。

A second caution relates to elaborative encoding. The mnemonic techniques are, as you have likely realized, an example of elaborative encoding in action, connecting the things we want to memorize (say, our shopping list) to something which already has meaning for us (say, our memory palace). By contrast, when an expert learns new information in their field, they don’t make up artificial connections to their memory palace. Instead, they find meaningful connections to what they already know. Those connections are themselves useful expertise; they’re building out a dense network of understanding. It’s a deeper and more desirable kind of expertise, connections native to the subject itself, not artificially constructed mnemonics.

第二个注意事项与精细编码有关。正如你可能已经意识到的那样，记忆技巧是精心编码的一个例子，它将我们想要记住的东西(例如，我们的购物清单)与对我们已经有意义的东西(例如，我们的记忆宫殿)联系起来。相比之下，当专家学习他们领域的新信息时，他们不会人为地将其与记忆宫殿联系起来。相反，他们会找到与他们已经知道的东西有意义的联系。这些连接本身就是有用的专业知识；他们正在建立一个密集的理解网络。这是一种更深入、更理想的专业知识，是与学科本身相关的连接，而不是人为构建的记忆技巧。

All this makes us seem negative about mnemonic techniques. In fact, we’re enthusiastic, and have to date certainly underused them in the mnemonic medium. What we’ve written here is merely meant to temper the over-enthusiasm we sometimes encounter. We’ve had people go so far as to tell us that mnemonics make memory a solved problem. That is simply false. But with their limitations understood, they’re a powerful tool. This is particularly true for knowledge which has an arbitrary, *ad hoc* structure. For example, it’s difficult to remember the colors of the rainbow because those colors are not obviously connected to anything else, unless you happen to have the [spectrum of visible light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum) memorized for other reasons! That makes a mnemonic like Roy G. Biv extremely helpful. And so mnemonic techniques should be thought of as a useful tool to use in building powerful memory systems, especially when combined with ideas such as spaced repetition.

所有这些都使我们看起来对记忆技巧持否定态度。事实上，我们很热心，而且到目前为止，在记忆媒介中肯定没有充分使用它们。我们在这里所写的只是为了缓和我们有时遇到的过度热情。有些人甚至告诉我们，记忆技巧使记忆成为一个已解决的问题。这根本是错误的。但是在了解了它们的局限性之后，它们是一个强大的工具。对于那些具有任意的、*临时的*结构的知识来说，这一点尤其正确。例如，很难记住彩虹的颜色，因为这些颜色与其他东西没有明显的联系，除非你碰巧因为其他原因记住了[可见光的光谱](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum)! 这使得像Roy G. Biv这样的记忆法非常有帮助。因此，记忆技巧应该被认为是一种有用的工具，用于建立强大的记忆系统，特别是当与间隔重复等理念相结合时。

## How important is memory, anyway?

## 记忆到底有多重要？

People tend to fall into two buckets when told of the mnemonic medium. One group is fascinated by the idea, and wants to try it out. The second group is skeptical or even repulsed. In caricature, they say: “Why should I care about memory? I want deeper kinds of understanding! Can’t I just look stuff up on the internet? I want creativity! I want conceptual understanding! I want to know how to solve important problems! Only dull, detail-obsessed grinds focus on rote memory.”

当被告知有记忆媒介时，人们往往分为两类。一类人对这个想法很着迷，并想尝试一下。第二类人则持怀疑态度，甚至是排斥。以漫画的形式，他们说："我为什么要关心记忆？我想要更深层次的理解！我不能直接查资料吗？我就不能在互联网上查查资料吗？我想要创造力！我想要概念性的理解！"。我想要概念性的理解! 我想知道如何解决重要的问题！只有沉闷的、痴迷于细节的磨练才会专注于死记硬背。"

It’s worth thinking hard about such objections. To develop the best possible memory system we need to understand and address the underlying concerns. In part, this means digging down far enough to identify the mistaken or superficial parts of these concerns. It also means distilling as sharply as possible the truth in the concerns. Doing both will help us improve and go beyond the current prototype mnemonic medium.

对于这样的反对意见，我们值得认真思考。为了开发最好的记忆系统，我们需要理解并解决潜在的担忧。在某种程度上，这意味着要深入挖掘，找出这些担忧中错误的或肤浅的部分。这也意味着要尽可能清晰地提炼出这些担忧中的真相。做到这两点将有助于我们改进和超越目前的原型记忆媒介。

One response to such objections is the argument from lived experience. In the past, one of us (MN) has often helped students learn technical subjects such as quantum mechanics. He noticed that people often think they’re getting stuck on esoteric, complex issues. But, as suggested in the introduction to this essay, often what’s really going on is that they’re having a hard time with basic notation and terminology. It’s difficult to understand quantum mechanics when you’re unclear about every third word or piece of notation. Every sentence is a struggle.

对这种反对意见的一个回应是生活经验的论证。过去，我们中的一个人(MN)经常帮助学生学习技术科目，如量子力学。他注意到，人们常常认为自己在深奥、复杂的问题上卡壳。但是，正如这篇文章的引言中所提出的，往往真正的情况是他们对基本的符号和术语感到为难。当你对每三个单词或符号不清楚时，就很难理解量子力学。每一句话都是一种挣扎。

It’s like they’re trying to compose a beautiful sonnet in French, but only know 200 words of French. They’re frustrated and think the trouble is the difficulty of finding a good theme, striking sentiments and images, and so on. But really the issue is that they have only 200 words with which to compose.

这就像他们试图用法语创作一首美丽的十四行诗，但只知道 200 个法语单词。他们很沮丧，认为麻烦在于难以找到一个好的主题、引人注目的情感和形象，等等。但实际上，问题在于他们只有 200 个单词可以用来创作。

At the time, MN’s somewhat self-satisfied belief was that if people only focused more on remembering the basics, and worried less about the “difficult” high-level issues, they’d find the high-level issues took care of themselves. What he didn’t realize is that this also applied to him. When he began using the memory system Anki to read papers in new fields, he found it almost unsettling how much easier Anki made learning the basics of such subjects. And it made him start wondering if memory was often a binding constraint in learning new fieldsSee [here](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html) and [here](http://cognitivemedium.com/srs-mathematics) for more on learning new fields using Anki[^20].

当时，MN 有点自以为是地认为，如果人们只专注于记住基础知识，而少担心那些 "困难的 "高层次问题，他们会发现高层次问题会自己解决的。他没有意识到，这也适用于他。当他开始使用记忆系统 Anki 来阅读新领域的论文时，他发现 Anki 使学习这些学科的基础知识变得非常容易，这几乎让他感到不安。这让他开始怀疑，在学习新领域的过程中，记忆是否经常是一种约束性的制约因素。见[这里](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html)和[这里](http://cognitivemedium.com/srs-mathematics)了解更多关于使用 Anki 学习新领域的情况。

One particularly common negative response to the mnemonic medium is that people don’t want to remember “unimportant details”, and are just looking for “a broad, conceptual understanding”. It’s difficult to know what to make of this argument. Bluntly, it seems likely that such people are fooling themselves, confusing a sense of enjoyment with any sort of durable understanding.

对记忆媒介的一个特别常见的负面反应是，人们不想记住 "不重要的细节"，而只是在寻找 "一个广泛的、概念性的理解"。很难知道该如何理解这种说法。直截了当地说，这样的人似乎是在愚弄自己，把享受的感觉和任何一种持久的理解混为一谈。

Imagine meeting a person who told you they “had a broad conceptual understanding” of how to speak French, but it turned out they didn’t know the meaning of “bonjour”, “au revoir”, or “tres bien”. You’d think their claim to have a broad conceptual understanding of French was hilarious. If you want to understand a subject in any real sense you need to know the details of the fundamentals. What’s more, that means not just knowing them immediately after reading. It means internalizing them for the long term[^21].

想象一下，如果遇到一个人告诉你，他们对如何说法语有 "广泛的概念性理解"，但事实证明，他们不知道 "bonjour"、"au revoir "或 "tres bien "的意思。你会觉得他们自称对法语有广泛的概念性理解是很搞笑的。如果你想在任何真正意义上理解一个主题，你需要知道基本原理的细节。更重要的是，这意味着不仅仅是在阅读后立即了解它们。这意味着长期内化它们。

A better model is that conceptual mastery is actually enabled by a mastery of details. One user of *Quantum Country* told us that she found the experience of reading unexpectedly relaxing, because she “no longer had to worry” about whether she would remember the content. She simply trusted that the medium itself would ensure that she did. And she reported that she was instead able to spend more of her time on conceptual issues.

一个更好的模式是，概念的掌握实际上是由对细节的掌握促成的。一位 "量子国度" 的用户告诉我们，她发现阅读的体验出乎意料地轻松，因为她 "不再需要担心" 她是否会记住内容。她只是相信媒介本身会确保她记得。她报告说，她反而能够把更多的时间花在概念性问题上。

When people respond to the mnemonic medium with “why do you focus on all that boring memory stuff?”, they are missing the point. By largely automating away the problem of memory, the mnemonic medium makes it easier for people to spend more time focusing on other parts of learning, such as conceptual issues.

当人们用 "你为什么要关注那些无聊的记忆东西？"来回应记忆媒介时，他们没有抓住重点。通过在很大程度上将记忆问题自动化，记忆媒介使人们更容易将更多的时间集中在学习的其他部分，如概念问题。

Another common argument against spaced repetition systems is that it’s better to rely on natural repetition. For instance, if you’re learning a programming language, the argument goes, you shouldn’t memorize every detail of that language. Instead, as you use the language in real projects you’ll naturally repeatedly use, and eventually commit to memory, those parts of the language most important to learn.

反对间隔重复系统的另一个常见论点是，最好是依靠自然重复。例如，如果你正在学习一门编程语言，这种说法认为，你不应该记住该语言的每一个细节。相反，当你在实际项目中使用该语言时，你会自然而然地重复使用，并最终将语言中最重要的部分记入记忆。

There are important partial truths in this. It is good to use what you’re learning as part of your creative projects. Indeed, an ideal memory system might help that happen, prompting you as you work, rather than in an artificial card-based environment. Furthermore, a common failure mode with memory systems is that people attempt to memorize things they’re unlikely to ever have any use for. For instance, it’s no good (but surprisingly common) for someone to memorize lots of details of a programming language they plan to use for just one small project. Or to memorize details “just in case” they ever need them. These patterns are mistakes.

这里面有重要的局部真理。把你所学的东西作为你创造性项目的一部分是很好的。事实上，一个理想的记忆系统可能有助于这种情况的发生，在你工作时提示你，而不是在一个基于卡片的人工环境中。此外，记忆系统的一个常见失败模式是，人们试图记住他们不太可能有任何用途的东西。例如，一个人背了很多他们打算在一个小项目中使用的编程语言的细节，这是不可取的(但令人惊讶的是，这很常见)。或者记住一些细节，"以备不时之需"。这些模式是错误的。

But the truths of the last paragraph also have limits. If you’re learning French, but don’t know any French speakers, then waiting for “natural opportunities” to speak just won’t work. And even if you do have (or create) opportunities to speak, it’s desirable to accelerate the awkward, uncomfortable early stages that form such a barrier to using the language.

但上一段的真理也有局限性。如果你正在学习法语，但不认识任何讲法语的人，那么等待 "自然机会" 说话是行不通的。而且，即使你有(或创造)说话的机会，最好也能加快尴尬的、不舒服的早期阶段，这对使用语言形成了很大的障碍。

It’s in this phase that memory systems shine. They can accelerate people through the awkward early stages of learning a subject. Ideally, they’ll support and enable work on creative projects. For this to work well takes good heuristics for what any given person should commit to memory; what is good for one person to memorize may be bad for another. Working such heuristics out is an ongoing challenge in the design of memory systems.

正是在这个阶段，记忆系统大放异彩。它们可以加速人们度过学习一个科目的尴尬的早期阶段。理想情况下，它们会支持和促成创造性项目的工作。要使这一工作顺利进行，需要对任何特定的人应该记忆的内容进行良好的启发式分析；对一个人来说，适合记忆的内容可能对另一个人来说是不好的。在记忆系统的设计中，解决这种启发式方法是一个持续的挑战。

(Incidentally, a surprising number of people say they are “repulsed”, or some similarly strong word, by spaced-repetition memory systems. Their line of argument is usually some variant on: it is claimed that spaced-repetition systems help with memory; if that is true I *must* use the systems; but I hate using the systems. The response is to deny the first step of the argument. Of course, the mistake is elsewhere: there is absolutely no reason anyone “should” use such systems, even if they help with memory. Someone who hates using them should simply choose not to do so. Using memory systems is not a moral imperative!)

(顺便提一下，有很多人说他们对间隔重复记忆系统感到 "厌恶"，或者用一些类似的强烈字眼。他们的论点通常是：据说间隔重复系统有助于记忆；如果这是真的，我*必须*使用这些系统；但我讨厌使用这些系统。他们的反应是否认论证的第一步。当然，错误在其他地方：绝对没有理由任何人 "应该" 使用这种系统，即使它们对记忆有帮助。讨厌使用它们的人应该简单地选择不这样做。使用记忆系统并不是一种道德上的要求！)

An immense amount of research has been done on the relationship of memory to mastery. Much of this research is detailed and context specific. But at the level of broader conclusions, one especially interesting series of studies was done in the 1970s by Herbert Simon and his collaborators. They studied chess players, and discovered that when master chess players look at a position in chess they don’t see it in terms of the individual pieces, a rook here, a pawn there. Instead, over years of playing and analyzing games the players learn to recognize somewhere between 25,000 and 100,000 patterns of chess pieces. These much more elaborate “chunks” are combinations of pieces that the players perceive as a unity, and are able to reason about at a higher level of abstraction than the individual pieces. At least in part it’s the ability to recognize and reason about these chunks which made their gameplay so much better than novices. Furthermore, although Simon did this work in the context of chess, subsequent studies have found [similar results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)) in other areas of expertise[^23]. It seems plausible, though needs further study, that the mnemonic medium can help speed up the acquisition of such chunks, and so the acquisition of mastery.

关于记忆与掌握的关系，已经有了大量的研究。这些研究中的大部分都是详细的、针对具体环境的。但是在更广泛的结论层面上，有一个特别有趣的系列研究是由赫伯特-西蒙和他的合作者在1970年代完成的。他们研究了国际象棋选手，并发现[^22]当国际象棋高手看国际象棋的局面时，他们不会从单个棋子的角度来看，这里有车，那里有兵。相反，在多年的对局和分析中，棋手们学会了识别25,000到100,000个棋子的模式。这些更复杂的 "组块" 是棋子的组合，棋手认为它们是一个整体，并且能够在比单个棋子更高的抽象水平上进行推理。至少在某种程度上，正是认识和推理这些棋子的能力使他们的棋艺比新手好得多。此外，尽管西蒙是在国际象棋的背景下做的这项工作，但随后的研究在其他专业领域也发现了[类似的结果](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology))。虽然需要进一步研究，但似乎是有道理的，记忆媒介可以帮助加速获得这些大块的内容，从而获得掌握。

So, does all this mean we’re fans of rote memory, the kind of forced memorization common schools?

那么，这一切是否意味着我们是死记硬背的粉丝，是普通学校那种强迫性的记忆？

Of course not. What we do believe is that many people’s dislike of rote memorization has led them to a generalized dislike of memory, and consequently to underrate the role it plays in cognition. Memory is, in fact, a central part of cognition. But the right response to this is not immense amounts of dreary rote memorization. Rather, it’s to use good tools and good judgment to memorize what truly matters.

当然不是。我们相信的是，许多人不喜欢死记硬背，导致他们普遍不喜欢记忆，并因此低估了记忆在认知中的作用。事实上，记忆是认知的一个核心部分。但正确的反应不是大量沉闷的死记硬背。相反，它是使用良好的工具和良好的判断力来记忆真正重要的东西。

We’ve identified some ways in which criticisms of memory systems are mistaken or miss the point. But what about the ways in which those criticisms are insightful? What are the shortcomings of memory systems? In what ways should we be wary of them?

我们已经确定了对记忆系统的批评在某些方面是错误的或错过了重点。但是，这些批评在哪些方面是有见地的呢？记忆系统的缺点是什么？我们应该在哪些方面对它们保持警惕？

We’ve already implicitly mentioned a few points in this vein. Think about problems like the need to avoid orphan questions. Or to make sure that users don’t merely learn surface features of questions. These are ways in which memory systems can fail, if used poorly. Here’s a few more key concerns about memory systems:

我们已经隐约提到了这一思路的几个要点。思考一些问题，比如需要避免孤立问题。或者确保用户不只是学习问题的表面特征。这些都是记忆系统可能失败的方式，如果使用不当的话。这里还有几个关于记忆系统的关键问题。

- Memory systems don’t make it easy to decide what to memorize: Most obviously, we meet a lot of people who use memory systems for poorly chosen purposes. The following is surprisingly close to a transcript of a conversation we’ve both had many times:

  > “I don’t like [memory system]. I tried to memorize the countries in Africa, and it was boring.”
  > “Why were you trying to remember the countries in Africa?”
  > [blank look of confusion.]

  It’s easy to poke fun at this kind of thing. But we’ve both done the equivalent in our own memory practices. Even some users of *Quantum Country* seem to be going through the motions out of some misplaced sense of duty. The question “what will be beneficial to memorize” is fundamental, and answering that question well is not trivial.

- 记忆系统并不容易决定要记忆什么：最明显的是，我们遇到很多人把记忆系统用于选择不当的目的。下面的内容出乎意料地接近于我们俩多次谈话的记录：

  > "我不喜欢[记忆系统]。我试图记住非洲的国家，这很无聊。"
  > "你为什么想记住非洲的国家？"
  > [茫然的疑惑表情] 。

  取笑这种事情很容易。但我们都在自己的记忆实践中做过类似的事情。甚至一些 "量子国度" 的用户似乎也是出于某种错位的责任感而走过场。"记忆什么会有好处" 这个问题是最基本的，而很好地回答这个问题并不是小事。

- **What’s the real impact of the mnemonic medium on people’s cognition? How does it change people’s behavior?** A famous boxer is supposed to have said that everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face. Regular users of memory systems sometimes report that while they can remembers answers when being tested by their system, that doesn’t mean they can recall them when they really need them. There can be a tip-of-the-tongue feeling of “Oh, I know this”, but not actual recall, much less the fluent facility one ultimately wants for effective action. Furthermore, the user may not even recognize opportunities to use what they have learned. More broadly: memory is not an end-goal in itself. It’s embedded in a larger context: things like creative problem-solving, problem-finding, and all the many ways there are of taking action in the world. We suspect the impact of memory systems will vary a lot, depending on their design. They may be used as crutches for people to lean on. Or they may be used to greatly enable people to develop other parts of their cognition. We don’t yet understand very well how to ensure they’re enablers, rather than crutches. But later in the essay we’ll describe some other tools for thought that, when integrated with memory systems, may better enable this transition to more effective action.

- **记忆媒介对人们的认知有什么真正的影响？它是如何改变人们的行为的？**一位著名的拳击手应该说过，每个人都有一个计划，直到他们被打脸。记忆系统的普通用户有时会报告说，虽然他们在接受系统测试时能记住答案，但这并不意味着他们在真正需要时能想起这些答案。可能会有一种 "哦，我知道这个 "的舌尖上的感觉，但不是真正的回忆，更不是一个人最终想要的有效行动的流畅的设施。此外，用户甚至可能没有意识到使用他们所学的东西的机会。更广泛地说：记忆本身不是一个最终目标。它被嵌入到一个更大的背景中：如创造性地解决问题，寻找问题，以及在这个世界上采取行动的所有许多方式。我们怀疑记忆系统的影响会有很大的不同，取决于它们的设计。它们可能被用作人们依赖的拐杖。或者它们可能被用来大大地使人们能够发展他们认知的其他部分。我们还没有很好地理解如何确保它们是助推器，而不是拐杖。但在文章的后面，我们将描述一些其他的思想工具，当它们与记忆系统整合时，可能会更好地使这种过渡到更有效的行动。



## How to invent Hindu-Arabic numerals?

## 如何发明印度-阿拉伯数字？

Let’s briefly get away from memory systems. Imagine you’re a designer living in ancient Rome, working for MDC (Mathematical Designs Corporation). A client comes in one day, expressing a desire to improve on Roman numerals. Of course, that’s not literally how they describe their problem to you – more likely it’s a tax collector wanting to tabulate taxes more efficiently, and having some vague notion that MDC may be able to help. But to you, an experienced designer, it seems that an improved system of numerals may be what they need.

让我们简单地脱离一下记忆系统。想象一下，你是一个生活在古罗马的设计师，为数学设计公司工作。有一天，一个客户来了，表达了对罗马数字进行改进的愿望。当然，这不是向你描述他们问题的字面意思--更有可能是一个收税员想更有效地报税，并且有一些模糊的概念，认为数学设计公司可能能够提供帮助。但对你这个有经验的设计师来说，改进后的数字系统可能就是他们所需要的。

How should you respond to this request? From our modern vantage point we know a vastly better system of numerals is possible, the Hindu-Arabic numerals. Hindu-Arabic numerals were, in fact, a great leap in the history of tools for thought. Could you, as a designer, have made that leap? What creative steps would be needed to invent Hindu-Arabic numerals, starting from the Roman numerals? Is there a creative practice in which such steps would be likely to occur?

你应该如何回应这一要求？从我们的现代观点来看，我们知道有一个更好的数字系统是可能的，那就是印度-阿拉伯数字。事实上，印度-阿拉伯数字是思想工具史上的一个巨大飞跃。作为一个设计者，你能实现这一飞跃吗？从罗马数字开始，需要哪些创造性的步骤来发明印度-阿拉伯数字？是否有一种创造性的做法，在这种做法中可能会出现这种步骤？

To be clear: this is a somewhat fanciful thought experiment. Many of the ideas needed to get to Hindu-Arabic numerals were, in fact, known earlier to the Babylonians, to the Greeks, and in other cultures. They were also inchoate in the abacus and similar devices. And so we’re not asking a literal historical question. Rather, it’s a question meant to stimulate thought: what *design process* could take you from Roman numerals to Hindu-Arabic numerals?

要明确的是：这是一个有点虚幻的思想实验。事实上，印度-阿拉伯数字所需的许多想法早在巴比伦人、希腊人和其他文化中就已存在。它们在算盘和类似的设备中也是初现端倪。因此，我们不是在问一个字面上的历史问题。相反，这是一个旨在激发思考的问题：什么*设计过程*能让你从罗马数字到印度-阿拉伯数字？

We can’t know the answer to this question for sure. But it’s worth pointing out that the Hindu-Arabic numerals aren’t just an extraordinary piece of design. They’re also an extraordinary mathematical insight. They involve many non-obvious ideas, if all you know is Roman numerals. Perhaps most remarkably, the meaning of a numeral actually *changes*, depending on its position within a number. Also remarkable, consider that when we add the numbers 72 and 83 we at some point will likely use 2+3=5; similarly, when we add 27 and 38 we will also use 2+3=5, despite the fact that the meaning of 2 and 3 in the second sum is completely different than in the first sum. In modern user interface terms, the numerals have the same affordances, despite their meaning being very different in the two cases. We take this for granted, but this similarity in behavior is a consequence of deep facts about the number system: commutativity, associativity, and distributivity[^24]. All these properties (and many more) point to the design and mathematical insights being inextricably entangled: the mathematical insights are, in some sense, design insights, and vice versa.

我们不能肯定地知道这个问题的答案。但值得指出的是，印度-阿拉伯数字不仅仅是一个非凡的设计。它们也是一个非凡的数学洞察力。如果你只知道罗马数字，它们涉及许多不显眼的想法。也许最引人注目的是，一个数字的含义实际上是*变化的*，这取决于它在一个数字中的位置。同样引人注目的是，考虑到当我们将数字72和83相加时，我们在某些时候可能会使用2+3=5；同样，当我们将27和38相加时，我们也会使用2+3=5，尽管事实上2和3在第二个和中的含义与第一个和完全不同。在现代用户界面术语中，尽管数字的含义在两种情况下有很大不同，但它们具有相同的承受力。我们认为这是理所当然的，但这种行为的相似性是数字系统的深层事实的结果：换元性、关联性和分布性。所有这些特性（以及更多的特性）都表明设计和数学的见解是不可分割地纠缠在一起的：在某种意义上，数学的见解就是设计的见解，反之亦然。

Indeed, it seems fair to say that any person who could invent Hindu-Arabic numerals, starting from the Roman numerals, would be both one of the great mathematical geniuses who ever lived, and one of the great design geniuses who ever lived. They’d have to be extraordinarily capable in both domains, capable of an insight-through-making loop which used the evolving system of numerals to improve not just their own mathematical ideas, but to have original, world-class insights into mathematics; and also to use those mathematical insights to improve their evolving system of numerals.

事实上，我们可以说，任何能够从罗马数字开始发明印度-阿拉伯数字的人，都将是有史以来最伟大的数学天才之一，也是有史以来最伟大的设计天才之一。他们必须在这两个领域都有超强的能力，能够利用不断发展的数字系统，不仅改进自己的数学思想，而且对数学有原创性的、世界级的见解；还能利用这些数学见解来改进他们不断发展的数字系统，从而形成一个洞察力的循环。

This is rather sobering if we compare to conventional modern design practice. In a typical practice, you’d interview domain experts (in this case, mathematicians), and read any relevant literature. You’d talk to users of existing systems, and analyze serious behavior, both individually and at scale. In short, you’d do what people in the design community refer to as immersing themselves in the target field.

如果我们与传统的现代设计实践相比，这就相当令人清醒了。在一个典型的实践中，你会采访领域专家(在这里是指数学家)，并阅读任何相关文献。你会与现有系统的用户交谈，并分析严肃的行为，包括个人和规模。简而言之，你要做的就是设计界人士所说的沉浸在目标领域中。

This is a powerful practice. At its best it causes systems to come into existence which would otherwise be inconceivable. If applied to Roman numerals (in hypothetical ancient Rome, not today[^25]) this practice would likely improve them a great deal. But it would not provide anywhere near the level of mathematical insight needed to arrive at Hindu-Arabic numerals.

这是一个强大的实践。在最好的情况下，它可以使系统出现，否则就无法想象。如果应用于罗马数字（在假想的古罗马，而不是今天），这种做法可能会大大改善它们。但它不会提供任何接近印度-阿拉伯数字所需的数学洞察力水平。

Our story about Hindu-Arabic numerals and mathematics is fanciful. But it expresses a general truth: *the most powerful tools for thought express deep insights into the underlying subject matter.* In the case of memory systems, this means they’re not just “applied cognitive science”, a collage of existing ideas from cognitive science pasted together using modern design practice. Rather, they will express deep original insights into memory, insights no-one else in the world has ever had. A truly great memory system will be cognitive science of the highest order.

我们关于印度-阿拉伯数字和数学的故事是虚构的。但它表达了一个普遍的真理：*最强大的思想工具表达了对潜在主题的深刻见解。*就记忆系统而言，这意味着它们不仅仅是 "应用认知科学"，是用现代设计方法将认知科学的现有观点拼贴在一起。相反，它们将表达对记忆的深刻的原创性见解，这些见解是世界上其他任何人都不曾有过的。一个真正伟大的记忆系统将是最高等级的认知科学。

From this discussion, we take away a warning and an aspiration.

从这次讨论中，我们得到了一个警告和一个愿望。

The warning is this: conventional tech industry product practice will not produce deep enough subject matter insights to create transformative tools for thought. Indeed, that’s part of the reason there’s been so little progress from the tech industry on tools for thought. This sounds like a knock on conventional product practice, but it’s not. That practice has been astoundingly successful at its purpose: creating great businesses. But it’s also what Alan Kay has dubbed a pop culture, not a research culture. To build transformative tools for thought we need to go beyond that pop culture.

警告是这样的：传统的科技行业产品实践不会产生足够深刻的主题洞察力来创造变革性的思想工具。事实上，这正是科技行业在思想工具方面进展甚微的部分原因。这听起来像是对传统产品实践的批评，但事实并非如此。这种做法在其目的上已经取得了惊人的成功：创造伟大的企业。但这也是Alan Kay所称的流行文化，而不是研究文化。为了建立变革性的思想工具，我们需要超越这种流行文化。

The aspiration is for any team serious about making transformative tools for thought. It’s to create a culture that combines the best parts of modern product practice with the best parts of the (very different) modern research culture. You need the insight-through-making loop to operate, whereby deep, original insights about the subject feed back to change and improve the system, and changes to the system result in deep, original insights about the subject.

这个愿望是针对任何认真制造变革性思想工具的团队的。这是为了创造一种文化，将现代产品实践的最佳部分与(非常不同的)现代研究文化的最佳部分相结合。你需要一个贯穿始终的循环来运作，通过这个循环，对被试的深刻的、原创的见解反馈来改变和完善这个系统，而系统的改变会导致对被试的深刻的、原创的见解。

![Diagram: 	'insight' and 'making', pointing to each other in a loop](https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/insight_through_making.svg)

Note that we are not making the common argument that making new tools can lead to new subject matter insights for the toolmaker, and vice versa. This is correct, but is much weaker than what we are saying. Rather: making new tools can lead to new subject matter insights *for humanity as a whole* (i.e., significant original research insights), and vice versa, and this would ideally be a rapidly-turning loop to develop the most transformative tools.

请注意，我们不是在做一个常见的论点，即制造新的工具可以为工具制造商带来新的主题见解，反之亦然。这是对的，但比我们说的要弱得多。相反，制造新的工具可以*为整个人类*带来新的主题见解(即重要的原创性研究见解)，反之亦然，而这最好是一个快速转动的循环，以开发最具变革性的工具。

Doing this is a cultural struggle. It seems to be extraordinarily rare to find the insight-through-making loop working at full throttle. People with expertise on one side of the loop often have trouble perceiving (much less understanding and participating in) the nature of the work that goes on on the other side of the loop. You have researchers, brilliant in their domain, who think of making as something essentially trivial, “just a matter of implementation”. And you have makers who don’t understand research at all, who see it as merely a rather slow and dysfunctional (and unprofitable) making process. This is certainly true in Silicon Valley, where it’s common to meet accomplished technical makers who, after reading a few stories from Richard Hamming and Richard Feynman, think they understand research well enough that they can “create the new Bell Labs”. Usually they’re victims of Dunning-Krugeritis, so ignorant they’re not even aware of their ignorance.

做到这一点是一场文化斗争。 在环路一侧拥有专业知识的人往往难以感知(更不用说理解和参与)环路另一侧的工作性质。你有研究人员，在他们的领域里很出色，但他们认为制造本质上是微不足道的，"只是一个实现的问题"。还有一些制造者根本不理解研究，他们认为研究只是一个相当缓慢和不正常的(而且不赚钱的)制造过程。在硅谷，这种情况是真实的。在那里，经常会遇到一些有成就的技术制造者，他们在读了Richard Hamming和Richard Feynman的一些故事后，认为他们对研究的理解足够深刻，可以 "创造新的贝尔实验室"。通常他们都是邓宁-克鲁格炎的受害者，他们如此无知，甚至没有意识到自己的无知。

Of course, we’ve got a long way to go with *Quantum Country*. It’s not yet generating nearly deep enough ideas about memory and cognition; it’s not yet one of the world’s foremost memory laboratories. And considered as a product, it’s also in the very earliest days; we’re not yet iterating nearly fast enough, nor learning nearly fast enough from the system. Getting the insight-through-making loop to operate at full throttle will mean reinventing parts of both research culture and conventional product development culture; it will mean new norms and a new type of person involved in key decision making. But that’s the aspiration, and what we believe is necessary to develop transformative tools for thought.

当然，我们在*量子国度*还有很长的路要走。它还没有产生关于记忆和认知的足够深入的想法；它还不是世界上最重要的记忆实验室之一。作为一个产品，它还处于最初的阶段；我们的迭代速度还不够快，从系统中的学习速度也不够快。 但这是一个愿望，也是我们认为开发变革性思想工具所必需的。

# Part II: Exploring tools for thought more broadly

# 第二部分：更广泛地探索思想的工具

We’ve examined the mnemonic medium in some depth. The intent was to show you the early stages in the development of a specific tool for thought, and some of the thinking enabled by that development. In this second part of the essay we explore more broadly, briefly sketching ideas for several other tools for thought. And we’ll address some broader questions, especially around why there hasn’t been more work on tools for thought.

我们已经比较深入地研究了记忆术的媒介。其目的是向你展示一个特定的思想工具发展的早期阶段，以及这种发展所带来的一些思考。在文章的第二部分，我们将进行更广泛的探索，简要地勾勒出其他几种思想工具的想法。我们还将讨论一些更广泛的问题，特别是围绕为什么没有更多关于思想工具的工作。

## Mnemonic video

## 记忆法视频

In 2014, the digital artist Eric Wernquist released an extraordinary short video entitled “[Wanderers](https://vimeo.com/108650530)”. The video provides a first-person glimpse of what it would be like to explore the Solar System:

2014年，数字艺术家Eric Wernquist发布了一个非凡的短视频，题为"[流浪者](https://vimeo.com/108650530)"。该视频以第一人称的方式介绍了探索太阳系的情况：

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/108650530?color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;badge=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay;

We hear the narrator’s (Carl Sagan) wonder and awe, and cannot help but empathize with his deep belief in the value of exploration. We get a sense of how many mysteries and how much beauty there is in our own cosmic neighborhood. The music begins with a wistful nostalgia for those of our ancestors who dared to explore, and then changes to convey excitement and danger and the boldness of those members of our and future generations who continue that exploration.

我们听到叙述者(卡尔-萨根)的惊奇和敬畏，不禁对他对探索的价值的深刻信念产生共鸣。我们感受到在我们自己的宇宙邻居中有多少神秘和多少美丽。音乐以对我们那些敢于探索的祖先的怀念开始，然后改变，传达出兴奋和危险，以及我们和后代继续探索的成员的勇气。

It’s interesting to contrast the video to the video’s script, a short text by Carl Sagan. The [text](http://mentalfloss.com/article/60335/wanderers-glimpse-humanitys-possible-future) is beautiful, but reading it is a much more remote and cerebral experience, conveying a much less visceral emotional understanding.

将这段视频与视频的脚本进行对比是很有意思的，这是卡尔-萨根的一篇短文。[文字](http://mentalfloss.com/article/60335/wanderers-glimpse-humanitys-possible-future)很美，但阅读它是一种更加遥远和脑力的体验，传达的是一种更不直观的情感理解。

We have a friend, Grant Sanderson, who makes astonishing mathematics videos on his YouTube channel, [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw). Below is one of our favorites, a video sketching a proof of a relatively recent research result in geometry, using ideas from algebraic topology. This sounds fearsome, but the video is beautiful and accessible, and has been viewed more than 1.2 million times.

我们有一个朋友，格兰特-桑德森，他在他的YouTube频道[3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw)上制作了令人惊讶的数学视频。下面是我们最喜欢的一个视频，它用代数拓扑学的思想勾勒出几何学中一个相对较新的研究结果的证明。这听起来很可怕，但这段视频很美，也很容易理解，而且已经被观看了120多万次。

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AmgkSdhK4K8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; background: transparent; box-sizing: border-box; width: 748px; height: calc(var(--width) / var(--aspect-ratio)); --aspect-ratio: 1.775;"></iframe>

As with *Wanderers*, watching this video is a remarkable emotional experience. It’s obvious the person narrating the video loves mathematics, and you cannot help but empathize. As you watch, you experience repeated “Ahah!” moments, moments of surprising insight, as connections that were formerly invisible become obvious. It shows mathematics as something beautiful, containing extraordinary ideas and intriguing mysteries, while at the same time showing that doing mathematics is not mysterious, that it is something anyone can understand and even do.

与《流浪者》一样，观看这段视频是一种非凡的情感体验。很明显，讲述视频的人热爱数学，而你不禁感同身受。当你观看时，你经历了反复的 "啊哈！"时刻，令人惊讶的洞察力时刻，因为以前看不见的联系变得明显。它显示了数学是一种美丽的东西，包含了非凡的想法和耐人寻味的奥秘，同时也显示了做数学并不神秘，它是任何人都可以理解甚至做的事情。

It’s tempting to overlook or undervalue this kind of emotional connection to a subject. But it’s the foundation of all effective learning and of all effective action. And it is much easier to create such an emotional connection using video than using text.

我们很容易忽视或低估这种与一个主题的情感联系。但它是所有有效学习和所有有效行动的基础。而且，使用视频比使用文字更容易建立这种情感联系。

There’s a flipside to this emotional connection, however. We’ve often heard people describe Sanderson’s videos as about “teaching mathematics”. But in conversation he’s told us he doesn’t think more than a small fraction of viewers are taking away much detailed understanding of mathematics. We suspect this is generally true, that high affect videos usually do little to change people’s detailed intellectual understanding. Rather, the extraordinary value of the videos lies in the emotional connection they create.

Is it possible to create a medium which blends the best qualities of both video and text?

In particular, is it possible to create a medium which has the emotional range possible in video – a range which can be used to convey awe and mystery and surprise and beauty? But which can also firmly ground that emotional connection in detailed understanding, the mastery of details which is the raison d’être of both conventional text and, perhaps even moreso, of the mnemonic medium?

We believe this may be possible, and we plan to develop a *mnemonic video* form that provides both the emotional connection possible in video, and the mastery of details possible in the mnemonic medium.

Creating such a form is challenging. Many MOOC platforms have attempted something a little in this vein. The typical approach is to have a low-affect talking head video, with the videos interrupted occasionally for brief quizzesThese images excerpted from [Astronomy: Exploring Time and Space](https://www.coursera.org/learn/astro).. Here’s how it works on one MOOC platform, Coursera:

然而，这种情感联系也有其反面。我们经常听到有人把桑德森的视频描述为 "教数学"。但在谈话中，他告诉我们，他不认为有超过一小部分的观众会对数学产生详细的理解。我们怀疑这通常是真的，高影响的视频通常不会改变人们详细的智力理解。相反，这些视频的非凡价值在于它们创造的情感联系。

有没有可能创造一种媒介，将视频和文本的最佳品质融合在一起？

特别是，是否有可能创造一种媒介，它具有视频中可能的情感范围--一种可以用来传达敬畏、神秘、惊讶和美丽的范围？但它也能将这种情感联系牢牢地建立在详细的理解上，即对细节的掌握，这是传统文本的存在理由，也许更多的是记忆性媒介的存在理由？

我们相信这是可能的，我们计划开发一种*记忆性的视频*形式，既提供视频中可能的情感联系，又提供记忆性媒介中可能的对细节的掌握。

创造这样一种形式是具有挑战性的。许多MOOC平台已经在这方面做了一些尝试。典型的方法是有一个低效果的谈话式视频，视频偶尔被打断，进行简短的测验。这些图片摘自[天文学：探索时间和空间](https://www.coursera.org/learn/astro)。以下是一个MOOC平台Coursera的运作方式:

![Figure depicting images of a 'talking head' lecture, alternating with dry, text-based multiple choice questions](https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/mnemonic_video_edx_sequence-2x.png)

Other MOOCs differ in the details. But the overall emotional experience may be summed up as:

其他MOOCs在细节上有所不同。但整体的情感体验可以总结为：

![Graph highlighting the sharp affective transitions between the lectures and the very low affect questions](https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/mnemonic_video_edx_graph-2x.png)

The very best parts of the video may be emotionally compelling, though it’s rare that they achieve the emotional range and connection of the best videos from people like Grant Sanderson. And the overall emotional experience is disjointed, almost repellent. Is it possible to create an integrated medium, with a unified and carefully crafted emotional and intellectual experience? Ideally, is it possible to create something like the following?

视频中最好的部分可能在情感上引人注目，尽管它们很少能达到格兰特-桑德森等人的最佳视频的情感范围和联系。而整体的情感体验是不连贯的，几乎是排斥的。是否有可能创造一个综合的媒介，有一个统一的、精心制作的情感和智力体验？理想情况下，是否有可能创造出像以下这样的东西？

![Hypothetical graph depicting smoother affective transitions and higher overall affect](https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/mnemonic_video_hypothetical_graph-2x.png)

In MOOCs, questions are typically presented in a very dry form, detached from context. In the mnemonic video the narrator would explain why the questions are important, and why the user will benefit from participating, as a seamless part of the overall narration. Done right – perhaps with appropriate music, and a sense of urgency or play in the narration – it would create a real sense of the stakes. At the same time, the video player can be modified so the user can respond directly to questions, as part of the spaced-repetition experience. The result would be much softer transitions between the high-affect core narration and the moderate-affect questions.

在MOOCs中，问题通常是以一种非常枯燥的形式呈现的，脱离了背景。在记忆性视频中，叙述者将解释为什么这些问题是重要的，为什么用户会从参与中受益，作为整个叙述的一个无缝部分。做得好的话--也许加上适当的音乐，以及叙述中的紧迫感或游戏--它将创造一种真正的利害关系感。同时，视频播放器可以被修改，以便用户可以直接回答问题，作为间隔重复体验的一部分。这样做的结果是，在高效果的核心叙述和中等效果的问题之间的过渡会柔和得多。

Here’s a short sketch of one approach to doing thisThe narrator’s script in this sketch is adapted from *Cosmos* (1984), episode 4., showing how the narrator could ask questions aloud as an integrated part of the overall narration:

这里有一个简短的草图，介绍了这样做的一种方法。这个草图中的叙述者的脚本改编自*宇宙*(1984)，第4集：

It seems likely that the rhythm of mnemonic videos would be quite different to mnemonic essays. In particularly, the frequency and density of questions would be lower than in the mnemonic medium, and it would be necessary to test different beats and cadences to ensure a good balance of emotional and intellectual experience. Even high-affect video typically has quieter moments; it achieves the high affect in part by contrast to the lower-intensity moments. Think about the way a good action movie or thriller needs lulls; if it’s too high-intensity all the time, eventually our emotional response is dulled. We could design mnemonic video so the questions help fill this lower-intensity emotional beat.

Of course, this is merely a quick sketch of one approach to the design of mnemonic video. Ideally, there would also be a spaced-repetition component, perhaps with the questions asked in text instead of video. This sort of sketch seems to us a promising direction, but needs considerable development and intense testing. In particular, we need to do detailed, second-by-second user experience testing, to understand and shape users’ emotional and intellectual experience. That would continue until we were confident that our target users were having the desired experience. Ideally, we’d also generate several more very different designs, and try to understand how each approach would impact the user’s emotional and intellectual experience.

The broader point here is about taking emotion seriously. Historically, a lot of work on tools for thought has either ignored emotion, or treated it as no more than a secondary concern. Instead, that work has focused on new skills acquired, on what the user “learns”. They’ve been designing for Spock, when emotional connection is a high-order bit. Do users feel disinterested? Afraid? Hostile? Anxious? Or do they internalize a sense of excitement, of beauty, perhaps even an expansion in their own goals, an expansion of their self?

By contrast, media forms such as movies and music and (often) video games do take emotion seriously. The designers of such forms often have incredibly elaborate models of user’s emotional responses. These models range from detailed, second-by-second understanding, to deep thinking about a user’s overall emotional journey. We believe it’s possible and desirable to use such approaches in the development of tools for thought.

At the same time, a positive emotional experience alone is not enough. For tools for thought to attain enduring power, the user must experience a real growth in mastery, an expansion in their ability to act. And so we’d like to take both the emotional and intellectual experience of tools for thought seriously. Mnemonic video is a good venue for such exploration. To paraphrase Einstein, attaining a detailed understanding without forming an emotional connection is lame; while forming an emotional connection without detailed understanding has no enduring power.

记忆性视频的节奏很可能与记忆性文章大不相同。特别是，问题的频率和密度会比记忆媒介低，而且有必要测试不同的节拍和节奏，以确保情感和智力体验的良好平衡。即使是高效果的视频通常也有比较安静的时刻；它实现高效果的部分原因是与低强度的时刻形成对比。想想一部好的动作片或惊悚片需要休息的方式；如果它一直都是高强度的，最终我们的情感反应会变得迟钝。我们可以设计记忆性视频，使问题有助于填补这种低强度的情感节拍。

当然，这仅仅是设计记忆性视频的一种方法的快速草图。理想情况下，还应该有一个间隔重复的部分，也许用文字而不是视频来提问。在我们看来，这种草图是一个有希望的方向，但需要大量的开发和密集的测试。特别是，我们需要做详细的、逐秒的用户体验测试，以了解和塑造用户的情感和智力体验。这将持续到我们确信我们的目标用户获得了所需的体验。理想情况下，我们也会产生几个非常不同的设计，并尝试了解每种方法会如何影响用户的情感和智力体验。

这里更广泛的观点是要认真对待情感。从历史上看，很多关于思想工具的工作要么忽略了情感，要么把它当作次要的问题。相反，这些工作都集中在获得的新技能上，集中在用户 "学到 "的东西上。他们一直在为斯波克设计，而情感连接是一个高阶的位子。用户是否感到不感兴趣？害怕吗？敌意？焦虑？还是他们内化了一种兴奋感、美感，甚至可能是他们自己目标的扩展，自我的扩展？

相比之下，媒体形式，如电影、音乐和(通常)电子游戏，确实认真对待情感。这类形式的设计者往往对用户的情绪反应有难以置信的精心设计的模型。这些模型的范围从详细的、逐秒的理解，到对用户的整体情感旅程的深入思考。我们相信，在思想工具的开发中使用这种方法是可能的，也是可取的。

同时，仅有积极的情感体验是不够的。为了使思想工具获得持久的力量，用户必须体验到真正的掌握能力的增长，扩大他们的行动能力。因此，我们要认真对待思想工具的情感和智力体验。记忆学视频是这种探索的一个好场所。用爱因斯坦的话说，获得详细的理解而不形成情感联系是很蹩脚的；而形成情感联系而不形成详细的理解则没有持久的力量。

## Why isn’t there more work on tools for thought today?

## 为什么今天没有更多关于思想工具的工作？

If tools for thought are so great, why isn’t more work being done on them? Why aren’t they a major industry?

As noted in the introduction, there’s certainly a lot of lip service paid. It is, for instance, common to hear technologists allude to Steve Jobs’s metaphor of computers as “bicycles for the mind”. But in practice it’s rarely more than lip service. Many pioneers of computing have been deeply disappointed in the limited use of computers as tools to improve human cognition. Douglas Engelbart [disparaged](http://dougengelbart.org/content/view/348/000/) the “dangerous, disappointing, narrow, path that we seem to be stuck with following”. When asked in 2006 how much of his vision had been achieved, Engelbart replied facetiously [“about 2.8 percent”](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/douglas-engelbart-invented-future-180967498/). Alan Kay gives talks asserting [“The real computer revolution hasn’t happened yet”](http://www.vpri.org/pdf/m2007007a_revolution.pdf) and in [an interview](https://www.fastcompany.com/40435064/what-alan-kay-thinks-about-the-iphone-and-technology-now) has described the modern web as “reinventing the flat tire… at least give us what Engelbart did, for Christ’s sake.”

Our experience is that many of today’s technology leaders genuinely venerate Engelbart, Kay, and their colleagues. Many even feel that computers have huge potential as tools for improving human thinking. But they don’t see how to build good businesses around developing new tools for thought. And without such business opportunities, work languishes.

What makes it difficult to build companies that develop tools for thought? To answer this, consider Adobe, one of the few large companies serious about developing new tools for thoughtAnother large company which takes tools for thought extremely seriously is AutoDesk. A similar story could be told about it.. It’s poured money into developing new mediumsThe plural of medium is, of course, media. However, in this context media would usually mean many pieces of new content. That’s not what we mean: we mean multiple different new mediums (*Illustrator*, *Photoshop* *etc*). We’ll reserve the unusual pluralization for this somewhat unusual meaning. for designers and artists – programs such as *Illustrator*, *Photoshop*, and so on. These mediums are remarkable tools for thought.

Unfortunately for Adobe, such mediums are extremely expensive to develop, and it’s difficult to prevent other companies from cheaply copying the ideas or developing near-equivalents. Consider, for example, the way the program *Sketch* has eaten into Adobe’s market share, after duplicating many of the best features from several of Adobe’s products, perhaps most notably *Illustrator*. And consider the way *Figma* is now eating into both *Sketch* and *Illustrator*’s market share. Both *Sketch* and *Figma* have done this without needing to make an enormous investment in research. That’s a big advantage they have over Adobe.

As Marc Andreessen has observedIn Elad Gil’s “High Growth Handbook” (2018).:

> true defensibility purely at the product level is really rare in [Silicon] Valley, because there are a lot of really good engineers… And then there’s the issue of leap-frogging. The next team has the opportunity to learn from what you did and then build something better.

Put another way, many tools for thought are public goods. They often cost a lot to develop initially, but it’s easy for others to duplicate and improve on them, free riding on the initial investment. While such duplication and improvement is good for our society as a whole, it’s bad for the companies that make that initial investment. And so such tools for thought suffer the fate of many public goods: our society collectively underinvests in them, relative to the benefits they provideOf course, it does cost money for companies such as *Sketch* and *Figma* to duplicate features originating in *Illustrator*, and they have introduced some improvements. So our characterization as a public good is only approximate..

Earlier, we argued that modern design practice generally isn’t up to the challenge of producing genuinely transformative tools for thought. On the surface, that process-level argument appears very different to the public goods argument we just made. In fact, the process-level explanation is a consequence of the public goods explanation: companies don’t use the necessary processes because there’s little value to them in doing so. By contrast, in “harder-tech” industries – say, chip design – companies have much more incentive to do deep research work. In those industries it’s considerably harder for other companies to duplicate or capture the value of that research.

如果思考的工具是如此的伟大，为什么没有更多的工作在他们身上进行？为什么它们不是一个主要的产业？

正如导言中所指出的，当然有很多口惠而实不至的事情。例如，经常听到技术专家提到乔布斯将计算机比喻为 "思想的自行车"。但在实践中，这很少是口惠而实不至。许多计算机的先驱者对计算机作为改善人类认知的工具的有限使用深感失望。道格拉斯-恩格尔巴特(Douglas Engelbart)[贬低](http://dougengelbart.org/content/view/348/000/)了 "危险的、令人失望的、狭窄的、我们似乎被困住的道路"。2006年，当被问及他的愿景实现了多少时，恩格尔巴特面带微笑地回答["大约2.8%"](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/douglas-engelbart-invented-future-180967498/)。Alan Kay在演讲中断言["真正的计算机革命还没有发生"](http://www.vpri.org/pdf/m2007007a_revolution.pdf)，并在[一次采访](https://www.fastcompany.com/40435064/what-alan-kay-thinks-about-the-iphone-and-technology-now)中把现代网络描述为 "重新发明爆胎......看在上帝的份上，至少给我们提供Engelbart所做的东西。"

我们的经验是，今天的许多技术领袖真正地崇敬恩格尔巴特、凯和他们的同事。许多人甚至觉得计算机作为改善人类思维的工具有着巨大的潜力。但他们不知道如何围绕开发新的思想工具建立良好的业务。而没有这样的商业机会，工作就会停滞不前。

是什么导致难以建立开发思想工具的公司？为了回答这个问题，考虑一下Adobe公司，它是少数几个认真开发新思想工具的大公司之一。关于它，也可以讲一个类似的故事。它把钱投入到开发新的媒介上。媒介的复数当然是指媒体。然而，在这种情况下，媒体通常意味着许多新的内容。这不是我们的意思：我们指的是多种不同的新媒介(*Illustrator*，*Photoshop*等等*)。我们将为这个有点不寻常的含义保留不寻常的复数。 对于设计师和艺术家来说--诸如*Illustrator*、*Photoshop*等程序。这些媒介是了不起的思想工具。

对Adobe来说，不幸的是，这种媒介的开发成本极高，而且很难阻止其他公司廉价地复制这些想法或开发出近乎同等的产品。例如，考虑到*Sketch*程序在复制了Adobe几个产品的许多最佳功能之后，已经蚕食了Adobe的市场份额，也许最明显的是*Illustrator*。而考虑到*Figma*现在正在蚕食*Sketch*和*Illustrator*的市场份额。*Sketch*和*Figma*都做到了这一点，而不需要在研究方面做出巨大的投资。这是他们相对于Adobe的一大优势。

正如Marc Andreessen所观察到的那样在Elad Gil的 "高增长手册"(2018)中。

>纯粹在产品层面的真正可防御性在[硅]谷真的很罕见，因为有很多真正优秀的工程师......然后还有一个跨越式发展的问题。下一个团队有机会从你的工作中学习，然后建立更好的东西。

换句话说，许多思想工具是公共产品。它们最初的开发成本往往很高，但其他人很容易复制和改进它们，免费乘坐最初的投资。虽然这种复制和改进对我们整个社会来说是好事，但对那些作出最初投资的公司来说却是坏事。当然，像*Sketch*和*Figma*这样的公司复制源自*Illustrator*的功能确实需要花钱，而且他们已经引入了一些改进。因此，我们将其定性为公共产品只是近似的。

早些时候，我们认为现代设计实践通常不能应对生产真正的思想变革工具的挑战。从表面上看，这个过程层面的论点似乎与我们刚才的公共产品论点非常不同。事实上，过程层面的解释是公共产品解释的一个结果：公司不使用必要的过程，因为这样做对他们没有什么价值。相比之下，在 "更难的技术 "行业--例如芯片设计--公司有更大的动力去做深入的研究工作。在这些行业中，其他公司要复制或获取这些研究的价值是相当困难的。

It’s illuminating to contrast with video games. Game companies develop many genuinely new interface ideas. This perhaps seems surprising, since you’d expect such interface ideas to also suffer from the public goods problem: game designers need to invest enormous effort to develop those interface ideas, and they are often immediately copied (and improved on) by other companies, at little cost. In that sense, they are public goods, and enrich the entire video game ecosystem.

But there’s a big difference between video game companies and companies such as Adobe. Many video games make most of their money from the first few months of sales. While other companies can (and do) come in and copy or riff on any new ideas, it often does little to affect revenue from the original game, which has already made most of its moneyIn fact, cloning is a real issue in gaming, especially in very technically simple games. An example is the game *Threes*, which took the developers more than a year to make. Much of that time was spent developing beautiful new interface ideas. The resulting game was so simple that clones and near-clones began appearing within days. One near clone, a game called *2048*, sparked a mini-craze, and became far more successful than *Threes*. At the other extreme, some game companies prolong the revenue-generating lifetime of their games with re-releases, long-lived online versions, and so on. This is particularly common for capital-intensive AAA games, such as the *Grand Theft Auto* series. In such cases the business model relies less on clever new ideas, and more on improved artwork (for re-release), network effects (for online versions), and branding.. While this copying is no doubt irritating for the companies being copied, it’s still worth it for them to make the up-front investment.

The net result is that in gaming, clever new interface ideas can be distinguishing features which become a game’s primary advantage in the marketplace. Indeed, new interface ideas may even help games become classics – consider the many original (at the time) ideas in games ranging from *Space Invaders* to *Wolfenstein 3D* to *Braid* to *Monument Valley*. As a result, rather than underinvesting, many companies make sizeable investments in developing new interface ideas, even though they then become public goods. In this way the video game industry has largely solved the public goods problems.

By contrast, a company like Adobe builds their business around distribution and long-term lock in. They convince people – indeed, entire organizations – to make long-term commitments to their products. Schools offer classes so people can call themselves “*Photoshop* experts” or “*Illustrator* experts”. Companies designate their design departments as “Adobe shops”. So while Adobe does invest in developing clever new interface ideas (for them, unlike the video game companies, this genuinely means tools for thought), it’s less central to their competitive advantage, and they invest less than they would if it was their central advantage. And Adobe does perhaps as much or more work developing tools for thought as any company.

It’s encouraging that the video game industry can make inroads on the public goods problem. Is there a solution for tools for thought? Unfortunately, the novelty-based short-term revenue approach of the game industry doesn’t work. You want people to really master the best new tools for thought, developing virtuoso skill, not spend a few dozen hours (as with most games) getting pretty good, and then moving onto something new.

与视频游戏相比，这很有启发性。游戏公司开发了许多真正的新界面创意。这也许令人惊讶，因为你会认为这种界面创意也会受到公共产品问题的影响：游戏设计师需要投入巨大的精力来开发这些界面创意，而这些创意往往会立即被其他公司复制(和改进)，而且成本不高。在这个意义上，它们是公共产品，丰富了整个视频游戏的生态系统。

但是，视频游戏公司和Adobe等公司之间有很大的区别。许多视频游戏从销售的前几个月赚取大部分的钱。虽然其他公司可以(而且确实)进来复制或翻版任何新的想法，但这往往对原始游戏的收入影响不大，因为它已经赚了大部分的钱。事实上，克隆是游戏中一个真正的问题，特别是在技术上非常简单的游戏。一个例子是游戏*Threes*，它的开发者花了一年多的时间来制作。其中大部分时间用于开发漂亮的新界面创意。所产生的游戏是如此简单，以至于在几天内就开始出现克隆和近似克隆的游戏。其中一个近似克隆的游戏名为*2048*，引发了一场小型热潮，并变得比*Threes*更成功。在另一个极端，一些游戏公司通过再版、长期在线版本等延长其游戏的创收期。这对于资本密集型的AAA级游戏尤其常见，如《侠盗猎车手》系列。在这种情况下，商业模式较少依赖聪明的新想法，而更多地依赖改进的艺术品(用于再版)、网络效应(用于网络版)和品牌效应。虽然这种抄袭对被抄袭的公司来说无疑是令人恼火的，但对他们来说，进行前期投资仍然是值得的。

最终的结果是，在游戏中，聪明的新界面创意可以成为游戏在市场上的主要优势的显著特征。事实上，新的界面创意甚至可以帮助游戏成为经典--想想看，从《太空入侵者》到《狼人杀3D》再到《纪念碑谷》等游戏中的许多原创(在当时)创意。因此，许多公司并没有投资不足，而是在开发新的界面创意方面进行了可观的投资，尽管它们后来成为了公共产品。通过这种方式，视频游戏行业在很大程度上解决了公共物品的问题。

相比之下，像Adobe这样的公司是围绕着分销和长期锁定来建立他们的业务。他们说服人们--实际上是整个组织--对其产品做出长期承诺。学校提供课程，使人们可以称自己为 "*Photoshop*专家 "或 "*Illustrator*专家"。公司将其设计部门指定为 "Adobe商店"。因此，尽管Adobe确实投资于开发聪明的新界面创意(对他们来说，与视频游戏公司不同，这真正意味着思考的工具)，但这对他们的竞争优势来说并不那么核心，而且他们的投资比他们作为核心优势时要少。而Adobe公司在开发思想工具方面所做的工作也许和任何公司一样多，甚至更多。

令人鼓舞的是，视频游戏行业可以在公共产品问题上取得进展。是否有解决思想工具的办法？不幸的是，游戏业以新奇为基础的短期收入方法并不奏效。你想让人们真正掌握最好的新思想工具，发展精湛的技能，而不是花几十个小时(像大多数游戏那样)获得相当好的效果，然后再转向新的东西。

Another plausible solution to the public goods problem is patents, granting a temporary monopoly over use of an invention. Many software companies, including Adobe, develop a large patent portfolio. However, the current patent system is not a solution for this problem. In 2017, Dana Rao, Adobe’s Vice President for Intellectual Property and Litigation, posted a [call](https://morningconsult.com/opinions/improving-patents-will-not-kill-innovation/) for major reforms to the patent system, stating that:

> [the patent] system is broken… What happened? A patent gold rush built by patent profiteers… Their value lies not in the innovation behind the patent but in the vagueness of the patent’s claims and the ability to enforce it in a plaintiff-friendly forum… Where did the material for these bad patents come from? The advent of software… This led to idea-only patents being granted with broad and often invalid claims, and eager patent profiteers were only too glad to take advantage.

Adobe shares in common with many other software companies that much of their patenting is defensive: they patent ideas so patent trolls cannot sue them for similar ideas. The situation is almost exactly the reverse of what you’d like. Innovative companies can easily be attacked by patent trolls who have made broad and often rather vague claims in a huge portfolio of patents, none of which they’ve worked out in much detail. But when the innovative companies develop (at much greater cost) and ship a genuinely good new idea, others can often copy the essential core of that idea, while varying it enough to plausibly evade any patent. The patent system is not protecting the right things.

Switching away from the viewpoint of individual companies, and to the viewpoint of society as a whole, not only do we want to incentivize invention, we also want ideas to move reasonably rapidly into the public domain. Think about fundamental tools for thought such as writing and the number system. Obviously, it’s good that those spread throughout society, unencumbered by IP concerns! More broadly, many tools of thought become more valuable for society as they become more ubiquitous. Again, here the modern patent system has numerous well-known problems, striking a poor balance between private and public interest. While a well-designed patent system might very well help solve the public goods problem, the patent system we actually have seems poorly adapted to the problem.

Is it possible to avoid the public goods problem altogether? Here’s three classes of tools for thought which do:



- Search engines such as Google are tools for thought. They avoid the public goods problem because their value is in their brand and in hard-to-duplicate and capital intensive backend elements (including their data centers, proprietary algorithms, ad network, and distribution), not in their interface ideas.
- A service such as Twitter can be considered a tool for collective thought. While the interface is easily copied, the company is hard to duplicate, due to network effects.
- Novel hardware devices (e.g., for VR, or the Wii remote, or for new musical instruments) can be used as the basis for new tools for thought. While hardware can be duplicated, it’s often much more expensive than duplicating software. And, in any case, the advantage for such companies is often in distribution, marketing, and relationships with vendors who make products for the platform.



While these suggestions all avoid the public goods problem, they don’t directly solve the public goods problem. And many promising directions – including ideas such as the mnemonic medium and mnemonic videos – involve a substantial public goods element. Is it possible to solve the public goods problem in such cases? The two most promising approaches seem to us to be:



- Philanthropic funding for research. This approach was used, for instance, by the field of computer animation and animated movies. Decades of public research work on computer animation resulted in a large number of powerful and (in many cases) publicly available ideas. This, in turn, helped prepare the way for companies such as Pixar and Dreamworks, which developed many of the ideas further, and took them to scale.
- The model used by Adobe and similar companies, in which new tools for thought are a central part of the company’s operations, but not the core of their competitive moat. That moat may instead be built around training, marketing, documentation, and so on.

公共产品问题的另一个看似合理的解决方案是专利，授予对一项发明的使用的临时垄断权。许多软件公司，包括Adobe，都开发了大量的专利组合。然而，目前的专利制度并不是这个问题的解决方案。2017年，Adobe公司负责知识产权和诉讼的副总裁Dana Rao发布了一份[呼吁](https://morningconsult.com/opinions/improving-patents-will-not-kill-innovation/)，要求对专利制度进行重大改革，他说。

>[专利]制度已经崩溃......发生了什么？一场由专利暴发户打造的专利淘金热......他们的价值不在于专利背后的创新，而在于专利权利要求的模糊性以及在有利于原告的论坛上强制执行的能力......这些不良专利的材料从何而来？软件的出现......这导致仅有创意的专利被授予宽泛且往往无效的权利要求，而热衷于专利的暴发户们非常乐意利用这一优势。

Adobe与许多其他软件公司的共同点是，他们的大部分专利都是防御性的：他们为想法申请专利，以便专利贩子无法就类似的想法起诉他们。这种情况几乎与你所希望的完全相反。创新型公司很容易受到专利巨头的攻击，这些巨头在庞大的专利组合中提出了广泛的、通常相当模糊的要求，而这些要求都没有经过他们的详细研究。但是，当创新公司(以更大的成本)开发并推出一个真正好的新想法时，其他人往往可以复制该想法的基本核心，同时对其进行足够的改变，以合理地规避任何专利。专利制度没有保护正确的东西。

从单个公司的角度出发，从整个社会的角度出发，我们不仅希望激励发明，还希望创意能够合理地迅速进入公共领域。想想基本的思想工具，如书写和数字系统。显然，这些工具在整个社会中传播，不受知识产权问题的约束，是一件好事。更广泛地说，许多思想工具随着它们变得更加普遍而对社会更有价值。同样，现代专利制度在这方面有许多众所周知的问题，在私人利益和公共利益之间取得了很差的平衡。虽然一个设计良好的专利制度很可能有助于解决公共物品问题，但我们实际拥有的专利制度似乎很不适应这个问题。

有没有可能完全避免公共物品问题呢？这里有三类思考工具，它们可以做到。



- 诸如谷歌这样的搜索引擎是思想的工具。他们避免了公共产品问题，因为他们的价值在于他们的品牌和难以复制和资本密集的后端元素(包括他们的数据中心、专有算法、广告网络和分销)，而不是他们的界面创意。
- 像Twitter这样的服务可以被认为是一种集体思考的工具。虽然界面很容易被复制，但由于网络效应，公司却很难被复制。
- 新颖的硬件设备(例如，用于VR，或Wii遥控器，或用于新乐器)可以作为新的思想工具的基础。虽然硬件可以被复制，但它往往比复制软件要昂贵得多。而且，在任何情况下，这类公司的优势往往在于分销、营销，以及与为该平台生产产品的供应商的关系。



虽然这些建议都避免了公共物品问题，但它们并没有直接解决公共物品问题。而许多有前途的方向--包括记忆媒介和记忆视频等想法--都涉及到大量的公共物品因素。在这种情况下有可能解决公共物品问题吗？在我们看来，两个最有希望的方法是。



- 为研究提供慈善资金。例如，计算机动画和动画电影领域就采用了这种方法。几十年来对计算机动画的公共研究工作产生了大量强大的、(在许多情况下)公开的想法。这反过来又帮助皮克斯和梦工厂等公司做好了准备，这些公司进一步发展了许多想法，并将其推向规模。
- Adobe和类似公司使用的模式，其中新的思想工具是公司运营的核心部分，但不是其竞争护城河的核心。这种护城河可能是围绕着培训、营销、文件等而建立的。

## Questioning our basic premises

## 对我们的基本前提提出质疑

There are three important premises we’ve taken for granted up to now. First is the assertion that we’re still in the early days, that many more transformative tools for thought are yet to be discovered. Second is the assertion that work on tools for thought is stalled, that there’s not lots of interesting work going on. And third, a kind of meta-premise, is the assertion that this kind of work is worth doing, relative to the current fashion for related ideas such as artificial general intelligence and brain-computer interfaces. In this section we discuss these premises.

到目前为止，有三个重要的前提我们都认为是理所当然的。首先是我们仍处于早期阶段的断言，还有许多变革性的思想工具尚未被发现。第二是关于思想工具的工作停滞不前的断言，即没有很多有趣的工作在进行。第三，一种元前提，是断言这种工作是值得做的，相对于目前的相关想法，如人工通用智能和脑机接口的时尚。在本节中，我们将讨论这些前提。

### What if the best tools for thought have already been discovered?

### 如果最好的思想工具已经被发现了呢？

In other words, perhaps the 1960s and 1970s were an unrepeatable golden age, and all we can expect in the future is gradual incremental improvement, and perhaps the occasional major breakthrough, at a decreasing frequency?

There’s a plausible story suggesting this is true. Tech is an enormous industry, well funded, with many bright, ambitious, talented people. Surely if there were major ideas to discover, people would do so? This argument is reinforced by the fact that, at the individual level, we meet many brilliant people who are fascinated by (and often working on) tools for thought, but who nonetheless seem to be making slow progress.

But while this story has a superficial appeal, it’s misleading. Really difficult problems – problems like inventing Hindu-Arabic numerals – aren’t solved by good intentions and interest alone. A major thing missing is foundational ideas powerful enough to make progress. In the earliest days of a discipline – the proto-disciplinary stage – a few extraordinary people – people like Ivan Sutherland, Doug Engelbart, Alan Kay, and Bret Victor – may be able to make progress. But it’s a very bespoke, individual progress, difficult to help others become proficient in, or to scale out to a community. It’s not yet really a discipline. What’s needed is the development of a powerful praxis, a set of core ideas which are explicit and powerful enough that new people can rapidly assimilate them, and begin to develop their own practice. We’re not yet at that stage with tools for thought. But we believe that we’re not so far away either.

While that argument is helpful context, it doesn’t address the core point: it doesn’t mean there are a lot of new transformative tools for thought waiting to be discovered. Again: maybe the most important tools for thought have already been discovered?

We can’t predict the future, so it’s not possible to answer this question with certainty. But it seems to us that the human race just hasn’t really tried very hard yet. When small groups of motivated people do – as in pioneering labs such as PARC, SRI, and other DARPA-inspired early efforts, as well as modern labs such as Dynamicland – they make rapid progress. It’s extremely encouraging that those efforts – tiny efforts, in the scheme of humanity’s overall research effort – make such rapid progress. To us, that suggests scaling them up, becoming much more ambitious.

换句话说，也许20世纪60年代和70年代是一个不可复制的黄金时代，而我们在未来所能期待的是逐渐增加的改进，也许偶尔会有重大突破，但频率会越来越低？

有一个看似合理的故事表明这是真的。科技是一个巨大的产业，资金充足，有许多聪明、有抱负、有才华的人。当然，如果有重大的想法可以发现，人们会这样做？在个人层面上，我们遇到了许多才华横溢的人，他们对思考的工具很着迷(而且经常在研究)，但他们似乎进展缓慢，这一论点得到了加强。

但是，虽然这个故事有表面上的吸引力，它却有误导性。真正困难的问题--像发明印度-阿拉伯数字这样的问题--并不是仅靠良好的愿望和兴趣就能解决的。缺少的一个主要东西是足以取得进展的基础性思想。在一个学科的早期--原生学科阶段--少数非凡的人--像伊万-萨瑟兰、道格-恩格尔巴特、艾伦-凯和布雷特-维克多这样的人--可能能够取得进展。但这是一个非常定制的、个人的进展，很难帮助其他人变得熟练，或扩展到一个社区。这还不是一门真正的学科。我们需要的是发展一个强大的实践，一套明确而强大的核心理念，使新人能够迅速吸收它们，并开始发展自己的实践。我们的思想工具还没有达到这个阶段。但我们相信，我们也不是那么遥远。

虽然这个论点是有帮助的背景，但它并没有解决核心问题：它并不意味着有很多新的变革性的思想工具等待我们去发现。再说一遍：也许最重要的思想工具已经被发现了？

我们无法预测未来，所以不可能肯定地回答这个问题。但在我们看来，人类只是还没有真正努力过。当一小群有动力的人这样做时--如PARC、SRI等先锋实验室和其他受DARPA启发的早期努力，以及Dynamicland等现代实验室--他们取得了快速的进展。这些努力--在人类整体研究工作中的微小努力--取得了如此快速的进展，是非常令人鼓舞的。对我们来说，这表明它们的规模扩大了，变得更加雄心勃勃了。

### Isn’t this what the tech industry does? Isn’t there a lot of ongoing progress on tools for thought?

### 这不正是科技行业所做的吗？不是有很多正在进行的思想工具的进展吗？

In particular, aren’t there already a lot of imaginative, determined, well-funded people working on this? Isn’t tech in considerable part already about developing new tools for thought?

Part of this question is caused by a confusion in terms. Obviously, many tech companies build special-purpose tools for solving specific problems. But while those may be valuable tools, they’re certainly not “tools for thought” in the broad sense we’re discussing – not like language or writing or, for that matter, Illustrator.

Still, there are tech companies which really do develop tools for thought. We already discussed some examples where companies have partially or totally avoided the public goods problem, tools such as: Illustrator, Google Search, Twitter, Slack, Google Docs, programmer toolsProgrammer tools are a case where the insight-through-making loop operates quite well. The avoidance of the public goods problem is enabled by a complex set of factors, including the fact that this is a case where many highly skilled researchers are simultaneously also accomplished makers, and it’s either their job to produce public goods (researchers) or an enjoyable hobby. To a lesser extent the same is true in the artistic and music communities., and so on. All really are significant tools for thought.

But consider our most fundamental tools for thought – language, writing, music, *etc*. Those are public goods. No-one owns language; to the extent that it is owned (trademarks and so on) it may actually limit the utility of language. These tools are all about introducing fundamental new mental representations and mental operations. Those aren’t owned by any company, they’re patterns owned by humanity.

This argument makes it seem likely that many of the most fundamental and powerful tools for thought do suffer the public goods problem. And that means tech companies focus elsewhere; it means many imaginative and ambitious people decide to focus elsewhere; it means we haven’t developed the powerful practices needed to do work in the area, and a result the field is still in a pre-disciplinary stage. The result, ultimately, is that it means the most fundamental and powerful tools for thought are undersupplied.

特别是，不是已经有很多富有想象力的、坚定的、资金充足的人在从事这项工作吗？科技在相当大的程度上不是已经在开发新的思想工具了吗？

这个问题的一部分是由术语的混淆引起的。显然，许多科技公司为解决特定的问题建立了特殊用途的工具。但是，尽管这些可能是有价值的工具，它们肯定不是我们所讨论的广义上的 "思想工具"--不像语言或写作，或者Illustrator那样。

尽管如此，还是有一些科技公司确实在开发用于思考的工具。我们已经讨论了一些公司部分或完全避免了公共物品问题的例子，这些工具包括。Illustrator, Google Search, Twitter, Slack, Google Docs, 程序员工具程序员工具是一个洞察力--通过制造循环运作得相当好的例子。避免公共产品问题是由一系列复杂的因素促成的，其中包括这样一个事实：在这种情况下，许多高技能的研究人员同时也是有成就的制造者，生产公共产品(研究人员)是他们的工作，或者是一种愉快的爱好。在较小的程度上，艺术和音乐界也是如此，等等。所有这些确实都是重要的思想工具。

但考虑到我们最基本的思想工具--语言、写作、音乐，*等等。这些都是公共产品。没有人拥有语言；在语言被拥有的程度上(商标等)，它实际上可能限制了语言的效用。这些工具都是关于引入基本的新的心理表征和心理操作。这些并不为任何公司所拥有，它们是人类拥有的模式。

这个论点使得许多最基本和强大的思想工具似乎有可能遭受公共物品问题。而这意味着科技公司把重点放在其他地方；意味着许多富有想象力和雄心勃勃的人决定把重点放在其他地方；意味着我们还没有发展出在该领域开展工作所需的强大实践，结果该领域仍然处于前学科阶段。最终的结果是，这意味着最基本和强大的思想工具供应不足。

### Why not work on artificial general intelligence (AGI) or brain-computer interfaces (BCI) instead?

### 为什么不在人工通用智能(AGI)或脑机接口(BCI)方面下功夫呢？

We’re often asked: why don’t you work on AGI or BCI instead of tools for thought? Aren’t those more important and more exciting? And for AGI, in particular, many of the skills required seem related.

我们经常被问到：为什么你们不研究 AGI 或 BCI，而要研究思想工具？这些不是更重要和更令人兴奋吗？特别是对于 AGI，许多所需的技能似乎是相关的。

They certainly are important and exciting subjects. What’s more, at present AGI and BCI are far more fashionable (and better funded). As a reader, you may be rolling your eyes, supposing our thinking here is pre-determined: we wouldn’t be writing this essay if we didn’t favor work on tools for thought. But these are questions we’ve wrestled hard with in deciding how to spend our own lives. One of us wrote a book about artificial intelligence before deciding to focus primarily on tools for thought; it was not a decision made lightly, and it’s one he revisits from time to time. Indeed, given the ongoing excitement about AGI and BCI, it would be surprising if people working on tools for thought didn’t regularly have a little voice inside their head saying “hey, shouldn’t you be over there instead?” Fashion is seductive.

它们当然是重要和令人兴奋的主题。更重要的是，目前 AGI 和 BCI 更时髦(而且资金更充足)。作为读者，你可能会翻白眼，认为我们的想法是预先确定的：如果我们不赞成思想工具的工作，我们就不会写这篇文章。但这些问题是我们在决定如何度过我们自己的生活时努力挣扎过的。我们中的一个人在决定把主要精力放在思想工具上之前写了一本关于人工智能的书；这不是一个轻率的决定，而且他时常会重新考虑这个问题。事实上，鉴于目前对 AGI 和 BCI 的兴奋，如果从事思想工具研究的人不经常有一个小声音在他们的头脑中说："嘿，你不应该在那边吗？" 时尚是诱人的。

One striking difference is that AGI and BCI are based on relatively specific, well-defined goals. By contrast, work on tools for thought is much less clearly defined. For the most part we can’t point to well-defined, long-range goals; rather, we have long-range visions and aspirations, almost evocations. The work is really about exploration of an open-ended question: how can we develop tools that change and expand the range of thoughts human beings can think?

一个明显的区别是，AGI 和 BCI 是基于相对具体、明确的目标。相比之下，思想工具方面的工作则没有那么明确的定义。在大多数情况下，我们不能指出明确的、长期的目标；相反，我们有长期的愿景和愿望，几乎是唤起的。这项工作实际上是对一个开放性问题的探索：我们如何开发工具来改变和扩大人类可以思考的思想范围？

Culturally, tech is dominated by an engineering, goal-driven mindset. It’s much easier to set KPIs, evaluate OKRs, and manage deliverables, when you have a very specific end-goal in mind. And so it’s perhaps not surprising that tech culture is much more sympathetic to AGI and BCI as overall programs of work.

从文化上讲，科技是由工程、目标驱动的思维方式所主导的。当你有一个非常具体的最终目标时，设置 KPI、评估 OKR 和管理交付物就容易得多。因此，科技文化对 AGI 和 BCI 作为整体工作计划更有同情心，这也许并不令人惊讶。

But historically it’s not the case that humanity’s biggest breakthroughs have come about in this goal-driven way. The creation of language – the ur tool for thought – is perhaps the most important occurrence of humanity’s existence. And although the origin of language is hotly debated and uncertain, it seems extremely unlikely to have been the result of a goal-driven process. It’s amusing to try imagining some prehistoric quarterly OKRs leading to the development of language. What sort of goals could one possibly set? Perhaps a quota of new irregular verbs? It’s inconceivable!

但从历史上看，人类最大的突破并不是以这种目标驱动的方式出现的。语言的创造——思维的工具——也许是人类存在的最重要事件。尽管对语言的起源有激烈的争论和不确定性，但它似乎极不可能是一个目标驱动的过程的结果。试着想象一些史前时期的季度 OKRs 导致语言的发展是很有趣的。一个人可能会设定什么样的目标呢？也许是一个新的不规则动词的配额？这是不可想象的。

Similarly, the invention of other tools for thought – writing, the printing press, and so on – are among our greatest ever breakthroughs. And, as far as we know, all emerged primarily out of open-ended exploration, not in a primarily goal-driven way. Even the computer itself came out of an exploration that would be regarded as ridiculously speculative and poorly-defined in tech today. Someone didn’t sit down and think “I need to invent the computer”; that’s not a thought they had any frame of reference for. Rather, pioneers such as Alan Turing and Alonzo Church were exploring extremely basic and fundamental (and seemingly esoteric) questions about logic, mathematics, and the nature of what is provable. Out of those explorations the idea of a computer emerged, after many years; it was a discovered concept, not a goal. Fundamental, open-ended questions seem to be at least as good a source of breakthroughs as goals, no matter how ambitious. This is difficult to imagine or convince others of in Silicon Valley’s goal-driven culture. Indeed, we ourselves feel the attraction of a goal-driven culture. But empirically open-ended exploration can be just as, or more successful.

同样，其他思想工具的发明——写作、印刷术等等——也是我们有史以来最伟大的突破之一。而且，据我们所知，所有这些都主要是在开放式的探索中出现的，而不是以目标为主导的方式。即使是计算机本身也是在探索中产生的，而这种探索在今天的技术领域中会被认为是可笑的投机性和定义不明确的。有人并没有坐下来想 "我需要发明计算机"；这不是他们有任何参考框架的想法。相反，像阿兰-图灵和阿隆佐-丘奇这样的先驱者正在探索关于逻辑、数学和可证明事物的性质的极其基本和根本的(而且似乎是深奥的)问题。在这些探索中，计算机的概念在多年后出现了；它是一个被发现的概念，而不是一个目标。基本的、开放性的问题似乎至少和目标一样是突破的源泉，无论多么雄心勃勃。在硅谷的目标驱动文化中，这一点很难想象或说服他人。事实上，我们自己也感受到了目标驱动文化的吸引力。但是，根据经验进行的开放式探索也可以同样，甚至更成功。

“What will new tools for thought be like?” is a question we hear often. And yet, almost by definition, we cannot say. As we noted earlier, if we could communicate the experience in an essay, then the tools would be failing at their job; they would not be transforming a person’s thinking, or even their consciousness. Concretely: to understand the mnemonic medium you must use it intensively over an extended period. And even then you may not be conscious of the effect; we’ve done interviews with users who are apparently unaware of the incredible level of recall they have of material in the essay they have read. One of the most famous papers in the philosophy of consciousness is entitled “What is it like to be a bat?” Each tool for thought poses a similar question, near impossible to answer without immersion in the tool: “What is it like to be a language user? A musician?” and so on.

"新的思想工具会是什么样的？"这是我们经常听到的一个问题。然而，根据定义，我们不能说。正如我们前面所指出的，如果我们可以在一篇文章中传达经验，那么这些工具将无法完成它们的工作；它们将无法改变一个人的思维，甚至是他们的意识。具体来说：要理解记忆媒介，你必须在很长一段时间内密集地使用它。即使如此，你也可能没有意识到这种效果；我们曾经采访过一些使用者，他们显然没有意识到他们对所读文章中的材料有令人难以置信的记忆水平。意识哲学中最著名的论文之一题为 "做一只蝙蝠是什么感觉？" 每个思想工具都提出了一个类似的问题，如果不沉浸在这个工具中，几乎不可能回答。"作为一个语言使用者是什么样子的？音乐家？"等等。

It seems plausible to us that work on tools for thought will be, over the next few decades, more important than work on AGI and BCI. And, given how fashionable and well-funded work on AGI and BCI currently is, it seems nearly certain that work on tools for thought offers vastly greater benefit, at the margin.

在我们看来，思考工具的工作在未来几十年将比AGI和BCI的工作更重要。而且，考虑到AGI和BCI的工作目前是多么时髦和资金充足，似乎几乎可以肯定，思想工具的工作在边缘上提供了巨大的利益。

What about the longer term? There, the situation is less clear. It seems likely that the three fields will merge, or at least feed strongly into one another. Together with Shan Carter, one of us has argued that one of the most promising applications for AI is as a way of discovering new tools for thoughtShan Carter and Michael Nielsen, [Using Artificial Intelligence to Augment Human Intelligence](https://distill.pub/2017/aia/) (2017)..

那么长期的情况呢？在这方面，情况不太清楚。这三个领域似乎很可能会合并，或者至少是彼此紧密联系在一起。我们中的一个人与 Shan Carter 一起认为，人工智能最有希望的应用之一是作为发现新的思想工具的一种方式 Shan Carter 和 Michael Nielsen，[使用人工智能来增强人类智能](https://distill.pub/2017/aia/) (2017).

BCI seems likely to be even more closely related. BCI is sometimes described using ideas like a memory chip for long-term memories, or some way of increasing short-term working memory. Such ideas may well become important. But it also seems possible that BCIs will be used to enable new mental operations, new mental representations, and new affordances for thought; in short, the same kind of things as are involved in developing non-BCI tools for thought. Perhaps we’ll develop the capacity to directly imagine ourselves in 4 or 5 or more dimensions; or traversing a Riemann manifold; or the ability to have multiple tracks of conscious attention. These are about changing the interface for thought, the basic abstractions and operations which are allowed. And so it seems plausible that work today on tools for thought will directly impact the way we use BCIs in the future.

BCI 似乎可能更密切相关。BCI 有时被描述为使用长期记忆的记忆芯片，或增加短期工作记忆的某种方式等想法。这样的想法很可能变得很重要。但 BCI 似乎也有可能被用于实现新的心理操作、新的心理表征和新的思维能力；简而言之，与开发非 BCI 思想工具所涉及的内容相同。也许我们会开发出直接想象自己在 4、5 或更多维度上的能力；或穿越黎曼流形；或拥有多个意识注意轨道的能力。这些都是关于改变思维的界面，允许的基本抽象和操作。因此，今天关于思想工具的工作将直接影响我们在未来使用BCI的方式，这似乎是合理的。

The computer scientist Peter Norvig has written an [interactive essay](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes/blob/master/ipynb/Economics.ipynb) discussing the distribution of wealth in society. Norvig’s essay is a Jupyter notebook which expresses many of the ideas in running Python code. That code sets up a population of agents, with an initial distribution of wealth. Agents randomly (and repeatedly) meet one another in pairs, and engage in simple economic transactions. More concretely: a simple transaction model could be that when two people meet, their joint wealth is pooled, and then randomly divided between the two of them. That model is just to give you the gist – more complex transaction models are, of course, possible. The notebook simulates how the distribution of wealth evolves over time.

计算机科学家 Peter Norvig 写了一篇[互动文章](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes/blob/master/ipynb/Economics.ipynb)，讨论社会中的财富分配问题。Norvig 的文章是一篇 Jupyter notebook，其中有许多想法通过运行 Python 代码表达。这段代码设置了一个由代理人组成的群体，以及一个初始的财富分布。代理人随机地(和重复地)成对相遇，并进行简单的经济交易。更具体地说：一个简单的交易模型可以是，当两个人相遇时，将他们的共同财富集中起来，然后在他们两个人之间随机分配。这个模型只是为了给你一个要点——当然，更复杂的交易模型是可能的。这篇 notebook 模拟了财富的分配是如何随时间演变的。

Part of what makes Norvig’s essay beautiful is that with just a few lines of Python code Norvig is able to show some surprising results about wealth inequality. For instance, his results suggest that the initial distribution of wealth in the economy doesn’t much affect the long-run distribution of wealth. Rather, it’s the nature of the transactions which determines the long-run distribution of wealth. This likely violates at least some user’s intuitions. As another example, his results also suggest that constraining agents to trade only with people geographically near them makes little difference to the final distribution of wealth.

Norvig 的文章之所以优美，部分原因在于仅用几行 Python 代码，Norvig 就能展示一些关于财富不平等的令人惊讶的结果。例如，他的结果表明，经济中财富的初始分配并不怎么影响财富的长期分配。相反，是交易的性质决定了财富的长期分配。这可能至少违反了一些用户的直觉。作为另一个例子，他的结果还表明，限制代理人只与他们在地理上接近的人进行交易，对财富的最终分配没有什么影响。

Results like these will challenge the intuition of some users. But instead of those challenges being on the basis of easily-ignored abstract arguments, users can immediately engage with Norvig’s model. Suppose someone doesn’t like the idea that the initial distribution of wealth doesn’t affect long-run wealth inequality. They’re challenged to find a counterexample, an initial distribution of wealth which does affect long-run inequality. They can experiment easily, making simple modifications to just one or a few lines of Python code, trying to find instances where the initial distribution matters. No matter whether they succeed or fail, they will build a better understanding of the problem[^35].

像这样的结果将挑战一些用户的直觉。但这些挑战不是基于容易被忽视的抽象论点，而是用户可以立即参与 Norvig 的模型。假设有人不喜欢财富的初始分配不影响长期财富不平等的观点。他们面临的挑战是找到一个反例，一个确实影响长期不平等的财富初始分配。他们可以很容易地进行实验，只需对 Python 代码的一行或几行进行简单的修改，试图找到初始分配重要的实例。无论他们是成功还是失败，他们都会对这个问题[^35]建立更好的理解。

Suppose the content of Norvig’s essay had instead been presented in a more conventional static form. For a reader to extend or interrogate the results would require total mastery of the material, and a high level of mathematical competence. But in the notebook format it’s much easier for the reader to experiment. Their exploration is scaffolded, they can make small modifications and see the results, even the answers to questions Norvig did not anticipate. This kind of scaffolded exploration is a way to build up their own understanding, and perhaps even push the frontiers of knowledge.

作为替代，假设 Norvig 的文章内容以更传统的静态形式呈现。对于一个读者来说，要扩展或质疑这些结果，需要完全掌握这些材料，并具有高水平的数学能力。但在 Notebook 的形式中，读者更容易进行实验。他们的探索是有框架的，他们可以做小修改并看到结果，甚至是诺维格没有预料到的问题的答案。这种有框架的探索是建立他们自己的理解的一种方式，甚至可能推动知识的前沿。

Norvig’s essay is one of thousands (or perhaps even millions) of Jupyter notebooks that have been created. Of course, most such notebooks are hastily and poorly written. But in the hands of an excellent writer and thinker like Norvig, notebooks can become remarkable environments for thought, both individual and shared. It’s tempting to regard them as merely a mashup of essay and code. But really they’re a new media form, with different possibilities from either essays or code, and with striking opportunities to go much further. In this section we explore those opportunities[^36].

Norvig 的文章是已经创建的成千上万(甚至数百万) Jupyter notebook 中的一个。当然，大多数这样的笔记本都写得很草率，很糟糕。但是，在像 Norvig 这样优秀的作家和思想家手中，notebook 可以成为非凡的思想环境，包括个人和共享。我们很想把它们看作是文章和代码的混合体。但实际上，它们是一种新的媒体形式，具有与文章或代码不同的可能性，并且有惊人的机会走得更远。在本节中，我们将探讨这些机会[^36]。

We described Norvig’s essay as an “interactive essay”. It’s useful to have a more specific term, to distinguish it from other interactive forms, like the mnemonic medium. In this essay, we’ll use the term “executable book”[^37]. We won’t define this precisely here; definition is not the point. Rather, the point is to try to better understand the potential of media forms which combine prose and code in something like this form.

我们把 Norvig 的文章描述为 "互动文章"。有一个更具体的术语是很有用的，可以把它与其他互动形式区分开来，比如记忆媒介。在这篇文章中，我们将使用 "可执行的书"[^37] 这个术语。我们不会在这里精确定义；定义不是重点。相反，重点是试图更好地理解以类似这种形式结合散文和代码的媒体形式的潜力。

### Tools for thought must be developed while doing serious work. The aspiration to canonical content

### 思考的工具必须在做严肃的工作时开发。对规范性内容的渴望

Seymour Papert, one of the principal creators of the Logo programming language, had a remarkable aspiration for Logo. Logo is sometimes described as a “programming language for children”, and people sometimes think Papert was mostly interested in helping children learn how to program. But that wasn’t Papert’s principal intent. Rather, Papert wanted to create an immersive environment – a kind of “Mathland” – in which children could be immersed in mathematical ideas. In essence, children could learn differential geometry by going to Mathland.

Seymour Papert 是 Logo 编程语言的主要创造者之一，他对 Logo 有一个非凡的愿望。Logo 有时被描述为一种 "儿童编程语言"，人们有时认为 Papert 主要对帮助儿童学习编程感兴趣。但这并不是 Papert 的主要意图。相反，Papert 想创造一个沉浸式环境——一种 "数学乐园"——让儿童沉浸在数学思想中。从本质上讲，孩子们可以通过去数学乐园学习微分几何。

It’s a beautiful aspiration, and Logo contains many striking ideas. But as far as we know, no professional differential geometer (or, more generally, mathematician) uses Logo seriously as a tool in their work. And upon reflection that seems troubling. If Logo genuinely expresses the ideas of differential geometry, why don’t differential geometers use it? You start to wonder: might it be that Logo leaves out important ideas about differential geometry, maybe even the most important ideas about differential geometry? After all, while mathematically trained, Papert wasn’t himself an accomplished differential geometer. How would he even have known what to include? And certainly most of the people interested in Logo aren’t qualified to make that judgment.

这是一个美丽的愿望，Logo 包含了许多引人注目的想法。但据我们所知，没有一个专业的微分几何学家(或更普遍的，数学家)在工作中认真使用 Logo 作为工具。仔细想来，这似乎令人不安。如果 Logo 真正地表达了微分几何的思想，为什么微分几何学家不使用它？你开始怀疑：是不是 Logo 遗漏了微分几何的重要思想，甚至可能是微分几何的最重要思想？毕竟，虽然受过数学训练，但 Papert 本人并不是一个有成就的微分几何学家。他怎么会知道应该包括什么呢？当然，大多数对 Logo 感兴趣的人也没有资格做出这种判断。

There’s a standard retort to this, which we’ve heard from within the Logo community. It’s to talk about the “floor” and “ceiling” of different environments for thought. In this account, Logo has a low floor (meaning anyone can use it) and a low ceiling (so it’s not well adapted for the sort of advanced work a professional would want to do).

对此有一个标准的反驳，我们在 Logo 社区中也听到过。这就是谈论不同思想环境的 "下限" 和 "上限"。在这种说法中，Logo 的下限很低(意味着任何人都可以使用它)，上限也很低(所以它不太适合专业人士想要做的那种高级工作)。

At first this sounds plausible. But upon reflection it’s difficult to make much sense of. How do the creators of Logo know that mastering Logo helps later with understanding real (forgive us!) differential geometry? What’s the criterion for success? One of us (MN) worked for several years doing research in the closely related field of Riemannian geometry. While Logo is enjoyable to use and contains many fun ideas, MN has trouble seeing that learning Logo would help much in learning differential geometry.

起初这听起来很有道理。但仔细一想，这很难让人理解。Logo 的创造者怎么知道掌握 Logo 有助于以后理解真正的(原谅我们！)微分几何？成功的标准是什么？我们中的一个人(MN)在与之密切相关的黎曼几何领域做了几年的研究。虽然 Logo 使用起来很愉快，而且包含了很多有趣的想法，但 MN 却很难看出学习 Logo 对学习微分几何有什么帮助。

At the end of Norvig’s economics essay is a short afterword explaining how he came to write the essay. Shortly before writing the essay he’d heard about the kinds of economic models discussed in the notebook, and he wanted to explore several questions about them. After talking it over with some colleagues they decided to each independently attack the problems, and to compare notes. Although Norvig’s essay is, in some sense, “educational”, Norvig’s intent was to explore a set of problems he himself was genuinely curious about. The educational aspect was a byproduct.

在 Norvig 的经济学论文的末尾，有一个简短的后记，解释了他是如何写这篇文章的。在写这篇文章前不久，他听说了笔记本中讨论的各种经济模型，他想探讨关于这些模型的几个问题。在与一些同事讨论后，他们决定各自独立地攻克这些问题，并比较笔记。虽然 Norvig 的文章在某种意义上是 "教育性的"，但 Norvig 的意图是探索一套他自己真正好奇的问题。教育方面是一个副产品。

And so what you have is a world-class research scientist who wanted to explore a set of questions. He used the Jupyter medium to do those explorations, and then to share that exploration with the world. And he shared it in a form where others could immediately build upon and extend his thinking.

因此，你所看到的是一个世界级的研究科学家，他想探索一系列的问题。他使用 Jupyter 媒介来做这些探索，然后与世界分享这些探索。他以一种他人可以立即建立和扩展他的思维的形式来分享它。

There’s a lot of work on tools for thought that takes the form of toys, or “educational” environments. Tools for writing that aren’t used by actual writers. Tools for mathematics that aren’t used by actual mathematicians. And so on. Even though the creators of such tools have good intentions, it’s difficult not to be suspicious of this pattern. It’s very easy to slip into a cargo cult mode, doing work that seems (say) mathematical, but which actually avoids engagement with the heart of the subject. Often the creators of these toys have not ever done serious original work in the subjects for which they are supposedly building tools. How can they know what needs to be included?

有很多关于思想工具的工作都是以玩具或 "教育" 环境的形式进行的。写作的工具不是由真正的作家使用的。数学工具不是由真正的数学家使用的。如此等等。即使这些工具的创造者有良好的意图，也很难不对这种模式产生怀疑。我们很容易陷入一种货物崇拜的模式，做一些看似(说)数学的工作，但实际上却避免了与这个主题的核心接触。这些玩具的创造者往往没有在他们所谓的建立工具的主题上做过认真的原创工作。他们怎么能知道需要包括什么呢？

Concretely: suppose you want to build tools for subject X (say X = differential geometry). Unless you are deeply involved in practicing that subject, it’s going to be extremely difficult to build good tools. It’ll be much like trying to build new tools for carpentry without actually doing any carpentry yourself. This is perhaps part of why tools like *Mathematica* work quite well – the principal designer, Stephen Wolfram, has genuine research interests in mathematics and physics. Of course, not all parts of *Mathematica* work equally well; some parts feel like toys, and it seems likely those are the ones *not* being used seriously internal to the company.

具体来说：假设你想为X学科(比如X=微分几何)建立工具。除非你深入地参与到该学科的实践中，否则要建立好的工具是非常困难的。这很像试图为木工建造新的工具，而自己却没有实际做任何木工工作。这也许是像 *Mathematica* 这样的工具运作良好的部分原因——主要设计者 Stephen Wolfram 对数学和物理学有真正的研究兴趣。当然，并不是 *Mathematica* 的所有部分都工作得同样好；有些部分感觉像是玩具，而且看起来很可能是那些*没有*被公司内部认真使用的部分。

There’s a general principle here: *good tools for thought arise mostly as a byproduct of doing original work on serious problems*. They tend either be created by the people doing that work, or by people working very closely to them, people who are genuinely bought in[^38]. Furthermore, the problems themselves are typically of intense personal interest to the problem-solvers. They’re not working on the problem for a paycheck; they’re working on it because they desperately want to know the answer.

这里有一个一般原则：*好的思想工具大多是在对严肃问题进行原始工作时产生的副产品*。他们往往要么是由从事这项工作的人创造的，要么是由与他们关系非常密切的人创造的，这些人是真正买办[^38]。此外，问题本身通常是问题解决者的强烈个人兴趣。他们不是为了薪水而工作，而是因为他们急切地想知道答案而工作。

Many people have asked why we wrote our first mnemonic essay about quantum computing. If we’d chosen an easier subject we could have attracted a much larger audience. But we also wanted the essay to be authentic, to be about problems we wanted to solve. One of us (MN) has done a lot of original research work on quantum computing. The essay reflects that thinking. Indeed, the framing of the essay is about answering a question MN personally wanted to answer: if humans ever discovered aliens, would they have computers, and if so, what types of computer would they have? This perhaps sounds like a contrived question, but it’s quite serious, and turns out to be a deep question with a nontrivial answer: writing the essay helped MN substantially improve his understanding of the question.

很多人问我们为什么要写第一篇关于量子计算的助记文章。如果我们选择一个更容易的主题，我们可以吸引更多的观众。但我们也希望文章是真实的，是关于我们想解决的问题。我们中的一个人(MN)做了很多关于量子计算的原创研究工作。这篇论文反映了这种想法。事实上，这篇文章的框架是关于回答 MN 个人想要回答的问题：如果人类发现了外星人，他们会不会有电脑，如果有，他们会有什么类型的电脑？这也许听起来像一个矫揉造作的问题，但它是相当严肃的，而且被证明是一个有不简单答案的深刻问题：写这篇文章帮助 MN 大大改善了他对这个问题的理解。

That said, answering that question wasn’t the principal point of creating the essay: making the mnemonic medium was. And for future work on tools for thought, it’d be valuable to push much harder on questions we’d genuinely like to answer ourselves. That’s a way of keeping yourself honest, ensuring you’re not just building a flashy toy, but something genuinely useful for solving real problems that are of independent interest.

也就是说，回答这个问题并不是创作这篇论文的主要目的：制作记忆媒介才是。对于未来的思想工具工作来说，在我们自己真正想回答的问题上更加努力是有价值的。这是一种让自己保持诚实的方式，确保你不只是在建造一个华丽的玩具，而是对解决真正的问题真正有用的、独立的兴趣。

In serious mediums, there’s a notion of *canonical media*. By this, we mean instances of the medium that expand its range, and set a new standard widely known amongst creators in that medium. For instance, *Citizen Kane*, *The Godfather*, and *2001* all expanded the range of film, and inspired later film makers. It’s also true in new media. YouTubers like Grant Sanderson have created canonical videos: they expand the range of what people think is possible in the video form. And something like the *Feynman Lectures on Physics* does it for textbooks. In each case one gets the sense of people deeply committed to what they’re doing. In many of his lectures it’s obvious that Feynman isn’t just educating: he’s reporting the results of a lifelong personal obsession with understanding how the world works. It’s thrilling, and it expands the form.

在严肃的媒体中，有一个*经典媒体*的概念。我们指的是扩大媒介范围的实例，并在该媒介的创作者中建立一个广为人知的新标准。例如，《公民凯恩》、《教父》和《2001》都扩大了电影的范围，并启发了后来的电影制作人。这在新媒体中也是如此。像格兰特-桑德森(Grant Sanderson)这样的 YouTubers 创造了经典的视频：他们扩大了人们认为在视频形式中可能存在的范围。而像*费曼物理学讲座*这样的东西对教科书来说也是如此。在每一种情况下，人们都能感受到人们对他们所做的事情的深刻承诺。在他的许多讲座中，很明显，费曼不仅仅是在教育：他是在报告他对理解世界如何运作的一生的个人痴迷的结果。这是令人激动的，而且它扩展了形式。

We’ve been disappointed by how unambitious people are in this sense with *Jupyter* notebooks. They haven’t pushed the medium all that hard; there is no *Citizen Kane* of Jupyter notebooks. Indeed, we’re barely beyond the Lumière brothers. Examples like Norvig’s notebook are fine work, but seem disappointing when evaluated as leading examples of the medium.

我们对人们在这个意义上对*Jupyter* notebook 的不抱希望感到失望。他们并没有那么努力地推动这个媒介；没有 Jupyter notebook 的*公民凯恩*。事实上，我们几乎没有超过卢米埃尔兄弟。像 Norvig 的笔记本这样的例子是很好的作品，但如果作为该媒介的主要例子来评估，似乎是令人失望的。

Aspiring to canonicity, one fun project would be to take the most recent IPCC climate assessment report (perhaps starting with a small part), and develop a version which is executable. Instead of a report full of assertions and references, you’d have a live climate model – actually, many interrelated models – for people to explore. If it was good enough, people would teach classes from it; if it was really superb, not only would they teach classes from it, it could perhaps become the creative working environment for many climate scientists.

为了实现经典性，一个有趣的项目是采用最新的 IPCC 气候评估报告(也许从一小部分开始)，并开发一个可执行的版本。你会有一个活生生的气候模型——实际上是许多相互关联的模型——供人们探索，而不是一个充满断言和参考的报告。如果它足够好，人们会用它来教课；如果它真的很好，他们不仅会用它来教课，它也许可以成为许多气候科学家的创造性工作环境。

One promising exploration in this direction is *[The Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/sicm_edition_2/book.html)*, a beautiful executable book building up classical mechanics. Many theorems of classical mechanics aren’t just expressed in static form, on the page, but live, as code which can be modified by the user. Theorems become APIs, which can literally be applied to other objects, and chained together. It uses a much more powerful underlying model than Jupyter, developing a new symbolic language as part of the book. It has many flaws – among them, the book doesn’t run live in the browser, making it difficult for users to experiment. And while the book is well written, the authors do not understand classical mechanics as deeply as the authors of some other books. But it’s nonetheless an inspiring evocation of what is possible. And it hints at what is possible when authors use executable books for a serious purpose, and aspire toward canonical media.

在这个方向上的一个有希望的探索是*[经典力学的结构和解释](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/sicm_edition_2/book.html)*，这是一本建立经典力学的美丽的可执行书。经典力学的许多定理并不只是以静态的形式表达在页面上，而是活生生的，作为用户可以修改的代码。这些定理变成了 API，可以真正应用于其他对象，并被串联起来。它使用了比 Jupyter 更强大的底层模型，开发了一种新的符号语言作为本书的一部分。它有很多缺陷——其中，该书不能在浏览器中实时运行，使得用户很难进行实验。而且，虽然这本书写得很好，但作者对经典力学的理解并不像其他一些书的作者那样深刻。但它还是对可能发生的事情进行了鼓舞人心的唤醒。它暗示了当作者将可执行的书籍用于严肃的目的，并向着经典媒体的方向发展时，可能会出现什么。

### Stronger emotional connection through an inverted writing structure

### 通过倒置的写作结构建立更强的情感联系

Consider an author writing a popular book about quantum mechanics. Such an author is in a strong position: they can begin their book with astonishing phenomena such as black hole evaporation, quantum teleportation, and the role of quantum fluctuations in the early universe. Or, if they wish, they can start with some of the deepest mysteries known to humanity: the relationship between quantum mechanics and gravity, or the quantum measurement problem. There is no shortage of extraordinary phenomena and beautiful mysteries. These are the kind of things which touch a chord inside many, perhaps most people. And so it’s relatively easy to draw readers in, to get them engaged, and keep them connected.

设想一个作者在写一本关于量子力学的畅销书。这样的作者处于强势地位：他们可以从黑洞蒸发、量子传送、量子波动在早期宇宙中的作用等惊人的现象开始写书。或者，如果他们愿意，他们可以从人类已知的一些最深奥的谜团开始：量子力学和引力之间的关系，或者量子测量问题。这里不乏非凡的现象和美丽的奥秘。这些都是触动许多人，也许是大多数人内心的弦的事情。因此，要吸引读者，让他们参与进来，并让他们保持联系，是相对容易的。

By contrast, consider a typical technical book about quantum mechanics. It’s very unlikely to start with black hole evaporation or quantum teleportation – and if it does, such a discussion will be perfunctory. Instead, it will start out drily, with technical minutiae. Complex numbers. Wavefunctions. Many different types of differential equations, and how to solve them. Hermitian and unitary operators. And so on, piece by piece slowly building up all the machinery needed to solve quantum mechanical problems. It may be tens or even hundreds of pages before the book begins to connect to the exciting problems which form the bread-and-butter of popular accounts.

相比之下，考虑一本关于量子力学的典型技术书籍。它不太可能从黑洞蒸发或量子传送开始——如果它这样做了，这样的讨论将是敷衍的。相反，它将以技术性的细枝末节开始。复数。波函数。许多不同类型的微分方程，以及如何解决它们。赫米特和单元运算符。以此类推，一块一块地慢慢建立起解决量子力学问题所需的所有机器。这本书可能要写几十页甚至几百页，才会开始与激动人心的问题联系起来，而这些问题构成了流行说法的面包和主食。

People with little experience doing good technical writing often complain about this dry, bottom-up approach. They will complain that writers should instead stay closer to the fun material, and use less technical notation and nomenclature. But when competent writers attempt to follow this prescription, invariably it works poorly.

没有什么好的技术写作经验的人经常抱怨这种干燥的、自下而上的方法。他们会抱怨说，作者应该更接近有趣的材料，并减少使用技术符号和术语。但是，当有能力的作家试图遵循这个处方时，无一例外地效果很差。

One problem is that a person can spend years reading analogies about black hole evaporation, quantum teleportation, and so on. And at the end of all that reading they typically have… not much genuine understanding to show for it. The analogies and heuristic reasoning simply don’t go far. They may be entertaining and produce some feeling of understanding. But the reasoning won’t scale out; it can’t be applied to other phenomena, at least not without lots of caveats, caveats the reader is in no position to understand or apply. As a result, good technical writers instead mostly build things up from first principles, with occasional digressions to the broader motivating picture. And that means starting with a lot of detailed, technical minutiae.

一个问题是，一个人可以花几年时间阅读关于黑洞蒸发、量子传送等的类比。而在所有这些阅读的最后，他们通常......没有多少真正的理解可以显示出来。类比和启发式推理根本没有走远。它们可能很有娱乐性，并产生一些理解的感觉。但推理不会扩展；它不能应用于其他现象，至少在没有大量警告的情况下，读者无法理解或应用这些警告。因此，优秀的技术作家大多从第一原理出发，偶尔会离题到更广泛的动机画面。而这意味着要从大量详细的技术细节开始。

It’s striking to contrast conventional technical books with the possibilities enabled by executable books. You can imagine starting an executable book with, say, quantum teleportation, right on the first page. You’d provide an interface – perhaps a library is imported – that would let users teleport quantum systems immediately. They could experiment with different parts of the quantum teleportation protocol, illustrating immediately the most striking ideas about it. The user wouldn’t necessarily understand all that was going on. But they’d begin to internalize an accurate picture of the meaning of teleportation. And over time, at leisure, the author could unpack some of what might *a priori* seem to be the drier details. Except by that point the reader will be bought into those details, and they won’t be so dry[^39]

将传统的技术书与可执行的书所带来的可能性进行对比是非常惊人的。你可以想象，在一本可执行的书中，比如说，量子传送，就在第一页开始。你会提供一个界面——也许是一个导入的库——让用户立即传送量子系统。他们可以实验量子传送协议的不同部分，立即说明关于它的最引人注目的想法。用户不一定能理解所有正在发生的事情。但他们会开始内化一个关于传送意义的准确图景。随着时间的推移，在闲暇的时候，作者可以解开一些*先验的*、似乎是比较枯燥的细节。只是到那时，读者会对这些细节信以为真，它们就不会那么枯燥了[^39]。

In other words, you could begin an executable book with material the users already care about, can connect to easily, and find motivating. For instance, you could begin by exploring teleportation or the Big Bang. But such an opening won’t suffer the drawback of popular science, of being vague and imprecise. Rather, the interface would be completely well specified. And, with some care, the interface could be scaled out, applied in ever-expanding contexts. The understanding would be transferable. Even a user who has understood only a tiny part of the material could begin tinkering, building up an understanding based on play and exploration. It’s common to dismiss such an approach as leading to a toy understanding; we believe, on the contrary, that with well enough designed scaffolding it can lead to a deep understanding[^40]. Developed in enough depth, such an environment may even be used to explore novel research ideas. To our knowledge this kind of project has never been seriously pursued. But it’d be fun to try.

换句话说，你可以用用户已经关心的、可以轻松联系的、觉得有动力的材料开始一本可执行的书。例如，你可以从探索传送或大爆炸开始。但这样的开头不会有大众科学的缺点，即模糊和不精确。相反，界面将被完全明确。而且，只要稍加注意，这个界面可以被扩展，应用于不断扩大的环境中。这种理解是可以转移的。即使是只理解了材料的一小部分的用户也可以开始修补，在游戏和探索的基础上建立起理解。人们通常认为这种方法会导致玩具式的理解；相反，我们认为，如果有足够好的脚手架设计，它可以产生深度理解[^40]。如果开发得足够深入，这样的环境甚至可以用来探索新的研究思路。据我们所知，这类项目从未被认真执行过。但尝试一下会很有趣。

# Summary and Conclusion

# 摘要和结论

We’ve covered a lot, and it’s helpful to distill the main takeaways – general principles, questions, beliefs, and aspirations. Let’s begin with memory systems, particularly the mnemonic medium:

- **Memory systems make memory into a choice, rather than an event left up to chance:** This changes the relationship to what we’re learning, reduces worry, and frees up attention to focus on other kinds of learning, including conceptual, problem-solving, and creative.
- **Memory systems are in their infancy:** it is possible to increase effective human memory by an order of magnitude, even beyond what existing memory systems do; and systems such as the mnemonic medium may help expand the range of subjects users can comprehend at all.
- **What would a virtuoso use of the mnemonic medium look like?** There’s some sense in which the mnemonic medium is “just” flash cards. The right conclusion isn’t that it’s therefore trivial; it’s that flash cards are greatly underrated. In writing *Quantum Country* we treated the writing of the cards with reverence; ideally, authors would take card writing as seriously as Nabokov took sentence writing. Of course, we didn’t reach that level, but the aspiration expands the reach of the medium. What would virtuoso or even canonical uses of the mnemonic medium look like?
- **Memory systems can be used to build genuine conceptual understanding, not just learn facts:** In *Quantum Country* we achieve this in part through the aspiration to virtuoso card writing, and in part through a narrative embedding of spaced repetition that gradually builds context and understanding.
- **Mnemonic techniques such as memory palaces are great, but not versatile enough to build genuine conceptual understanding:** Such techniques are very specialized, and emphasize artificial connections, not the inherent connections present in much conceptual knowledge. The mnemonic techniques are, however, useful for bootstrapping knowledge with an *ad hoc* structure.
- **Memory is far more important than people tend to think:** It plays a role in nearly every part of cognition, including problem-solving, creative work, and meta-cognition. The flip side is that memory systems themselves want to grow into other types of tools – tools for reading, tools for problem-solving, tools for creating, tools for attention management. That said, we don’t yet know what memory systems want to be. To reiterate: memory systems are in their infancy.

我们已经涵盖了很多内容，提炼出主要的收获——一般原则、问题、信念和愿望，是有帮助的。让我们从记忆系统开始，特别是记忆媒介：

- **记忆系统使记忆成为一种选择，而不是由机会决定的事件：**这改变了我们与所学内容的关系，减少了担忧，并解放出注意力，使之集中于其他类型的学习，包括概念性的、解决问题的和创造性的。
- **记忆系统正处于起步阶段：**有可能将人类的有效记忆提高一个数量级，甚至超过现有记忆系统的作用；而记忆媒介等系统可能有助于扩大用户完全可以理解的主题范围。
- **记忆媒介的精湛使用会是什么样子？**在某种意义上，记忆媒介 "只是" 闪卡。正确的结论不是说它因此是微不足道的；而是说闪卡被大大低估了。在写作《量子国度》时，我们以崇敬的态度对待卡片的书写；理想情况下，作者会像纳博科夫对待句子的书写一样认真对待卡片的书写。当然，我们没有达到这个水平，但这个愿望扩大了媒介的范围。记忆媒介的精湛或甚至经典的使用会是什么样子？
- **记忆系统可以用来建立真正的概念性理解，而不仅仅是学习事实：**在《量子国度》中，我们部分通过对大师级卡片写作的渴望来实现这一目标，部分通过对间隔重复的叙述性嵌入来逐渐建立起背景和理解。
- **记忆宫殿等记忆技巧很好，但不足以建立真正的概念性理解：**这种技术非常专业，强调的是人为的联系，而不是许多概念性知识中存在的内在联系。然而，记忆技巧对于引导具有结构的知识是很有用的。
- **记忆比人们想象的要重要得多：**它几乎在认知的每个部分都起着作用，包括解决问题、创造性工作和元认知。反过来说，记忆系统本身想成长为其他类型的工具——阅读的工具、解决问题的工具、创造的工具、注意力管理的工具。这就是说，我们还不知道记忆系统想要成为什么。要重申的是：记忆系统正处于起步阶段。

The mnemonic medium is merely one prototype tool for thought. We also discussed several other ideas, including mnemonic video and executable books. Here are some key takeaways:

- **What practices would lead to tools for thought as transformative as Hindu-Arabic numerals? And in what ways does modern design practice and tech industry product practice fall short?** To be successful, you need an *insight-through-making loop* to be operating at full throttle, combining the best of deep research culture with the best of Silicon Valley product culture.
- **Tools for thought are (mostly) public goods, and as a result are undersupplied:** That said, there are closely-related models of production which have succeeded (the games industry, Adobe, AutoDesk, Pixar). These models should be studied, emulated where possible, and used as inspiration to find more such models.
- **Take emotion seriously:** Historically, work on tools for thought has focused principally on cognition; much of the work has been stuck in Spock-space. But it should take emotion as seriously as the best musicians, movie directors, and video game designers. Mnemonic video is a promising vehicle for such explorations, possibly combining both deep emotional connection with the detailed intellectual mastery the mnemonic medium aspires toward.
- **Tools for thought must be developed in tandem with deep, original creative work:** Much work on tools for thought focuses on toy problems and toy environments. This is useful when prototyping, but to be successful such tools must ultimately be used to do serious, original creative work. That’s a baseline litmus test for whether the tools are genuinely working, or merely telling a good story. Ideally, for any such tool there will be a stream of canonical media expanding the form, and entering the consciousness of other creators.

记忆媒介仅仅是思想的一个原型工具。我们还讨论了其他几个想法，包括助记视频和可执行的书。以下是一些关键的收获。

- **什么样的做法会导致像印度-阿拉伯数字那样的思想工具的转变？现代设计实践和科技行业的产品实践在哪些方面存在不足？**要想成功，你需要一个*洞察力的制造循环*全速运转，将深度研究文化的精华和硅谷产品文化的精华结合起来。
- **思考的工具是(大部分)公共产品，因此供应不足：** 也就是说，有一些密切相关的生产模式已经成功了(游戏业、Adobe、AutoDesk、Pixar)。这些模式应该被研究，在可能的情况下被模仿，并作为灵感来寻找更多这样的模式。
- **认真对待情感：**历史上，关于思想工具的工作主要集中在认知方面；许多工作都停留在 Spock 空间。但它应该像最好的音乐家、电影导演和视频游戏设计师一样认真对待情感。助记视频是这种探索的一个有希望的载体，可能将深层的情感联系与记忆媒介所渴望的详细的智力掌握相结合。
- **思考的工具必须与深入的、原创性的工作同步发展：**许多关于思考工具的工作集中在玩具问题和玩具环境上。这在原型设计时是有用的，但要想成功，这些工具最终必须被用来做严肃的、原创的创造性工作。这是检验这些工具是否真正有效，或者仅仅是在讲一个好故事的基本试金石。理想情况下，对于任何这样的工具，都会有一个典型的媒体流来扩展这个形式，并进入其他创作者的意识中。

Let’s return to the question that began the essay: how to build transformative tools for thought? Of course, we haven’t even precisely defined what such transformative tools are! But they’re the kind of tools where relatively low cost changes in practice produce transformative changes in outcome – non-linear returns and qualitative shifts in thinking. This is in contrast with the usual situation, where a small change in practice causes a small change in results.

让我们回到文章开头的那个问题：如何建立变革性的思想工具？当然，我们甚至还没有精确地定义这种变革性工具是什么！但它们是那种以相对较低的成本改变实践而产生变革性结果的工具。但它们是那种实践中相对低成本的变化在结果中产生变革性变化的工具——非线性的回报和思维的质变。这与通常的情况相反，即实践中的小变化导致结果的小变化。

Historically, humans have invented many such transformative tools for thought. Writing and music are ancient examples; in modern times, tools such as *Photoshop* and *AutoCAD* qualify. Although it’s very early days, we believe the mnemonic medium shows much promise. It needs to be developed much further, along the lines we’ve described, and likely requires additional powerful ideas. But we believe it’s possible for humanity to have a widespread memory practice that radically changes the way we think.

历史上，人类已经发明了许多这样的思维转换工具。写作和音乐是古老的例子；在现代，像 *Photoshop* 和 *AutoCAD* 这样的工具也符合条件。虽然现在还很早，但我们相信记忆媒介显示了很大的前景。它需要沿着我们所描述的路线进一步发展，并可能需要更多强大的想法。但我们相信，人类有可能拥有一个广泛的记忆实践，从根本上改变我们的思维方式。

More broadly, we hope the principles in this essay will help support the creation of more transformative tools for thought. Historically, most invention of tools for thought has been done bespoke, by inspired individuals and groups. But we believe that in the future there will be an established community that routinely does this kind of invention.

更广泛地说，我们希望这篇文章中的原则将有助于支持创造更多变革性的思想工具。从历史上看，大多数思想工具的发明都是由受启发的个人和团体定制完成的。但我们相信，在未来，会有一个既定的社区经常进行这样的发明。

[^4]:An account may be found in Iverson’s Turing Award lecture, [Notation as a Tool of Thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/Iverson1979.pdf) (1979). Incidentally, even Iverson is really describing a medium for thought, the APL programming language, not a narrow tool. 可以从Iverson在Turing奖获奖演讲 [Notation as a Tool of Thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/Iverson1979.pdf) (1979). 顺便说一下, Iverson这里描述的实际上是一种思考媒介APL语言, 而不是狭义的工具.
[^Mass Point 2 ]:这一段后面部分翻得不是很好, 甚至可能有理解错误, 原文如下To the extent that such a tool succeeds, it expands your thinking beyond what can be achieved using existing tools, including writing. The more transformative the tool, the larger the gap that is opened. Conversely, the larger the gap, the more difficult the new tool is to evoke in writing. But what writing can do, and the reason we wrote this essay, is act as a bootstrap. It’s a way of identifying points of leverage that may help develop new tools for thought. So let’s get on with it. 
[^Mass Point 3]: 这里把idea翻译为想法有点不太合中文的表达习惯, 因为这里的idea明显指的是一些具象化的概念与公式, 但中文里"想法"一词多指一些形而上的东西. 请校对时再斟酌一下
[^Mass Point 4]: *mnemonic medium*直译有点莫名其妙, 翻成"带有辅助记忆功能的媒介"又太拖沓. 定稿的时候可以再讨论一下

[^译1]: 译者注: 根据Frank Portman的解读, 这句话想表达的意思是**写**音乐这事和朝着建筑物跳舞一样无厘头(后面的介词to为了达到一种结构上的对仗和语意上的荒谬被故意写成了about), 音乐不应该是用写的, 而是一种内在体验的自然表达.

[^Mass Point 5]: mnemonic essays的翻译有待讨论,直译有点莫名其妙
[^7]: Particularly careful readers may wonder how this is possible, given that we stated earlier that the first review interval is 5 days. The explanation is that we recently modified the review schedule so the first review is after 5 days. For most of *Quantum Country*’s history the review schedule was more conservative, and this is the reason for the difference.. 特别细心的读者可能会觉得这里的叙述和前面有点冲突——明明我们才说过, 第一次复习的间隔是5天. 是这样的, 我们最近重新安排了复习间隔, 所以第一次复习变成了5天之后. 但量子国度早期的复习间隔是比较保守的, 这就是造成差异的原因. 
[^8]: In the movie *The Matrix* one of the characters (Neo) uses a computer to very rapidly upload martial arts skills into his mind. As he opens his eyes after completing the upload he tells another character (Morpheus): “I know Kung Fu”. 在电影《黑客帝国》中, 其中一个角色(Neo)使用电脑快速地将功夫上传到他的脑海中. 当他完成上传后睁开眼睛, 对另一个角色(Morpheus)说: 「I know Kung Fu」.
[^9]: We’ve made no attempt at all to scale this out. It’s interesting to ponder doing so. 我们还没有尝试去扩大规模, 但那样做应该会很有趣. 
[^10]: In more detail: there were 16 users in the group that did the reviews, per usual, and 25 users in the group where reviews were delayed. The 95% confidence intervals were: 91 ± 4%, 87 ± 5%, 89 ± 5%, 96 ± 3%, assuming each variable is binomial, independent and identically distributed. This latter assumption is approximate, since we’d expect some user- and question-dependent effects. Note also that this was done in an earlier version of *Quantum Country*, where the review schedule had intervals of one day, three days, one week, and and two weeks. 细节在这: 有16个用户照常复习, 另外25个用户被延迟复习. 95%的置信区间是: 91±4%, 87±5%, 89±5%, 96±3%, 假设每个变量都是二项, 独立以及独立同分布的。后一个假设是近似的，因为我们期望一些与用户和与问题相关的影响. 还要注意, 这个实验是在早期版本的量子国度中完成的, 在早起版本中, 复习间隔为一天, 三天, 一周和两周.
[^11]:Strictly speaking, Quizlet’s basic product doesn’t use spaced repetition. There is, however, a paid version using spaced repetition, and it’s otherwise quite similar to many of these systems. 严格来说, 基础版的Quizlet并不支持间隔重复, 只有付费版的Quizlet才支持间隔重复. 除此之外, Quizlet和其他的记忆系统别无二致.
[^12]:They are, however, widely used within some interesting niche audiences. For instance, there is a [thriving population](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki/) of medical students using Anki. 不过, 这些系统在一些小圈子里得到了广泛的应用. 比如, 医学生里用Anki的人数正在与日俱增.

Some fascinating earlier work in a related vein was done by Adrian D. de Groot, and summarized in his book *Thought and Choice in Chess* (1965).例如，见William G. Chase和Herbert A. Simon, [Perception in Chess](https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/Chase197s.pdf) (1973)。阿德里安-D-德格罗特在相关领域的早期工作很有吸引力，并在他的《国际象棋中的思考与选择》一书中进行了总结*（1965）。 
[^23]: We’ve met many mathematicians and physicists who say that one reason they went into mathematics or physics is because they hated the rote memorization common in many subjects, and preferred subjects where it is possible to derive everything from scratch. But in conversation it quickly becomes evident that they have memorized an enormous number of concepts, connections, and facts in their discipline. It’s fascinating these people are so blind to the central role memory plays in their own thinking. 我们见过许多数学家和物理学家，他们说他们进入数学或物理学的一个原因是他们讨厌许多学科中常见的死记硬背，而更喜欢那些有可能从头开始推导出一切的学科。但在交谈中，人们很快就会发现，他们已经记住了他们学科中大量的概念、联系和事实。令人着迷的是，这些人对记忆在他们自己的思维中所扮演的核心角色如此视而不见。 
[^24]: The same phenomenon occurs in the conventional grade-school algorithms for multiplication and division. One of us has spun a short piece of [discovery fiction](https://twitter.com/michael_nielsen/status/1174420006907473920) discussing in more detail the way a hypothetical designer might have arrived at these ideas. 同样的现象也发生在传统的小学乘法和除法的算法中。我们中的一个人写了一篇简短的[发现小说](https://twitter.com/michael_nielsen/status/1174420006907473920)，更详细地讨论了一个假想的设计者可能得出这些想法的方式。 
[^25]: Of course, a designer who spoke to an expert on, say, Babylonian mathematics, might well have come across some of these ideas. We’ll ignore that, since it depends on the oddity that many excellent prior ideas about numeral systems had been displaced in Roman culture. 当然，一个设计者如果与巴比伦数学方面的专家交谈，很可能会遇到其中的一些想法。我们将忽略这一点，因为这取决于一个奇怪的现象，即之前关于数字系统的许多优秀想法在罗马文化中已经被取代。
[^35]: Sufficiently motivated reasoners will, of course, ignore any conclusion they don’t like. Such people are most likely a lost cause to serious thought. 当然，有足够动机的推理者会忽略任何他们不喜欢的结论。
[^36]:Of course, systems like Jupyter go back decades. There are antecedents in Knuth’s notion of literate programming, in Mathematica notebooks, in PARC’s Learning Research Group, in the PLATO system (and, more broadly, computer-assisted instruction), to name but a few. In the discussion below we emphasize opportunities that seem to us undervalued in many of these prior systems. 当然，像 Jupyter 这样的系统可以追溯到几十年前。在 Knuth 的识字编程概念中，在 Mathematica notebook 中，在 PARC 的学习研究小组中，在 PLATO 系统（以及更广泛的计算机辅助教学）中，都有一些先例，仅举几例。在下面的讨论中，我们强调了在许多这些先前的系统中似乎被低估的机会。
[^37]:This is, of course, a placeholder term. “Executable essay” would in many ways be more natural, though unfortunately that term is perhaps even more naturally interpreted as meaning “web page”, in the current context. 当然，这是一个占位的术语。"可执行的文章" 在许多方面会更自然，尽管不幸的是，在目前的语境中，这个词也许更自然地被解释为 "网页"。
[^38]:A related argument has been made in Eric von Hippel’s book “Democratizing Innovation” (2005), which identifies many instances where what appears to be commercial product development is based in large or considerable part on innovations from users. Eric von Hippel的《创新的民主化》（2005）一书中提出了一个相关的论点，该书指出了许多看似商业化的产品开发在很大程度上或相当程度上是基于用户的创新。
[^39]:A similar argument has been made by Rachel Thomas, [Providing a Good Education in Deep Learning](https://www.fast.ai/2016/10/08/teaching-philosophy/) (2016). Rachel Thomas 也提出了类似的论点，[提供良好的深度学习教育](https://www.fast.ai/2016/10/08/teaching-philosophy/) (2016)。
[^40]:The masters of this are video game designers. See, for example, Dan Cook, [Building a Princess Saving App](https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/Cook2008.pdf) (2008), and Jonathan Blow and Marc ten Bosch, [Designing to Reveal the Nature of the Universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGSeLSmOALU) (2011). 例如，见丹-库克，[建立一个拯救公主的应用程序](https://numinous.productions/ttft/assets/Cook2008.pdf) (2008)，以及乔纳森-布洛和马克-腾-博世，[设计揭示宇宙的本质](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGSeLSmOALU) (2011)。

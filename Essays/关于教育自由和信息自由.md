# On freedom of education and freedom of information 关于教育自由和信息自由

# Freedom to learn 学习的自由

Full educational freedom implies freedom to choose one's own way of thinking about the world. It implies one's own choice of sources of information.

充分的教育自由意味着选择自己思考世界的方式的自由。它意味着一个人可以自己选择信息来源。

Those who believe freedom is dangerous for the integrity of democratic society make the same mistake as those who claim that social media undermine the wisdom of the masses, or that, in the most extreme case, "*[Internet makes us stupid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is_Google_Making_Us_Stupid%3F)*".

那些认为自由对民主社会的完整性有危险的人犯了同样的错误，就像那些声称社交媒体破坏了大众的智慧，或者在最极端的情况下，"互联网让我们变得愚蠢"的人一样。

All those claims come from the wrong interpretation of the evolution of knowledge.

所有这些说法都来自于对知识进化的错误解释。

# One truth 一个事实

The whole human knowledge and our perception of reality rely on basic axioms:

1. some of the information coming in via our senses is true, and
2. there is one truth.

整个人类的知识和我们对现实的认知都依赖于基本的公理：

1. 通过我们的感官传入的一些信息是真实的，并且
2. 有一个事实

Information science does the rest: false information is eliminated by statistical confrontation with the body of knowledge. The brain forms models using simple neural network [generalizations](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Generalization). Those can get distorted by [cognitive biases](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Cognitive_bias) and need to be worked on with the tools of science to verify their validity, and to sift away the impact of human error and emotion. Scientific models are formulated using pragmatic [Occam's razor principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor).

信息科学做的是：通过统计对抗知识体系，消除虚假信息。大脑使用简单的神经网络泛化形成模型。这些可能会被认知偏差扭曲，需要用科学的工具来验证其有效性，并筛选掉人为错误和情绪的影响。科学模型的制定要用实用主义的奥卡姆剃刀原理。

Willy nilly we need to assume that human knowledge converges upon some approximation of true reality. There is no point in arguing those basic axioms as we have no other alternative. Approximation of the truth is a convergent process that occurs in any dynamic body of knowledge. It occurs in our heads as we grow up and try to make sense of the world. It occurs in societies. It occurs in science. It occurs in expert systems empowered with probabilistic assertions.

无论如何，我们需要假设人类的知识在某种程度上收敛于真实的现实。争论这些基本公理是没有意义的，因为我们没有其他选择。对真理的近似是一个收敛的过程，它发生在任何动态的知识体系中。当我们长大并试图理解这个世界时，它发生在我们的头脑中。它发生在社会中。它发生在科学中。它发生在拥有概率论断的专家系统中。

In the chapter on [self-directed learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_history:_school_vs._self-directed_learning), I try to show how people tend to [converge on similar themes](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_history:_school_vs._self-directed_learning#Convergence_of_knowledge) and memes in history. It does not take long for a student to hit the immortal memes of pyramids, Guttenberg, Napoleon, Hiroshima or Hitler. Here comes the origin of [Argumentum Ad Hitlerum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_Hitlerum) in a loose discourse.

在自学这一章中，我试图说明人们是如何收敛于历史上类似的主题和模因的。对于一个学生来说，用不了多久就会撞上金字塔、古滕贝格、拿破仑、广岛或希特勒这些不朽的记忆。这里是Argumentum Ad Hitlerum的起源，在一个松散的话语中。

The same convergence occurs in the whole spectrum of human knowledge. [Diversification](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Diversity) is healthy. Like pieces of knowledge attracted to individual semantic tree leaves, people of different skills fit the jigsaw puzzle of the economy. This is a galactic process of information [self-organization](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Emergence) that propels mankind to new heights.

同样的收敛发生在人类知识的整个范围内。多样化是健康的。就像被个别语义树叶吸引的知识碎片一样，不同技能的人适合经济的拼图。这是一个信息自组织的星系过程，推动人类走向新的高度。

The evolution of knowledge is a powerful and positive process, which is accelerated by access to information and communication. It has been accelerated by language, written records, printing press, telegraph, telephone, radio, television, mass media, web, and now social media. At each acceleration stage there are skeptics who see and bemourn the decline of humanity, trivialization of knowledge, dumbification of the masses, distortions of reality, fake news, etc. As much as the biological evolution leads to indeterminate outcomes, so does the evolution of knowledge (see: [Value of wrong models](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Value_of_wrong_models)). However, statistically, the process is convergent and our approximation of reality, given the original axioms, is getting better and better.

知识的进化是一个强大而积极的过程，信息的获取和交流加速了这一过程。语言、文字记录、印刷术、电报、电话、广播、电视、大众传媒、网络以及现在的社交媒体都加速了这一进程。在每一个加速阶段，都有怀疑论者看到并哀叹人性的衰落、知识的琐碎化、大众的愚钝化、现实的扭曲、假新闻等。就像生物进化会导致不确定的结果一样，知识的进化也是如此（见：错误模型的价值）。不过，从统计学上看，这个过程是收敛的，我们对现实的近似，在原有公理的基础上，越来越好。

**Evolution of knowledge is convergent onto an ever improving approximation of reality. Accelerated dissemination of information, accelerates the convergence of knowledge**

**知识的进化是收敛于不断改进的现实近似。信息的加速传播，加速了知识的收敛。**

Books were considered seditious. Press wars sparked [otherworldly hoaxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Moon_Hoax) and yellow journalism. Telegraph was seen as a likely channel for gossip. Telephone was to destroy human personal interaction. Radio was to be the means of propaganda. Television was to promote lewdness. Mass media was to dumb down the masses with tabloid press and mindless entertainment. It has always been the same problem: popularity sparks vulgarity. Web was to flood us with [infobabble](http://www.super-memory.com/english/ol/knowmachine.htm). These days, after a short romance with the democratization effect of the [Arab Spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring), more and more people see social media as a channel for fake news again. The yearning for the reinstitution of the one and only truth is the domain of well-schooled brains (see: [50 bad habits learned at school](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/50_bad_habits_learned_at_school)). This yearning leads to new calls for censorship, political correctness and even the denunciation of digital media (see: [Digital Dementia](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Digital_Dementia)).

书籍被认为是煽动性的。 新闻大战引发了超乎寻常的骗局和黄色新闻。电报被认为是一个可能的八卦渠道。电话破坏了人与人之间的交流。广播是宣传的手段。电视是宣传淫秽的工具。大众传媒是要用小报和无意识的娱乐来使大众变得迟钝。一直以来都是同一个问题：流行引发低俗。网络用信息垃圾淹没我们。如今，在经历了 "阿拉伯之春 "民主化效应的短暂浪漫之后，越来越多的人又把社交媒体看作是假新闻的渠道。对恢复唯一真理的渴望是受过良好教育的大脑的领域（见：在学校学到的 50 个坏习惯）。这种渴望导致了对审查制度、政治正确甚至谴责数字媒体的新呼吁（见：数字痴呆症）。

# Internet makes us stupid 互联网让我们变得愚蠢

[Nicholas Carr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_G._Carr) is one of the most prominent journalists complaining that "[the Internet makes us stupid!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is_Google_Making_Us_Stupid%3F)". Carr is wrong. The exact opposite is true (see: [proof](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Proof:_Internet_makes_us_smarter)).

尼古拉斯-卡尔是最著名的记者之一，他抱怨 "互联网让我们变得愚蠢！"。卡尔错了。事实恰恰相反（见：证据）。

It is quite natural for a journalist with a flair for "deep thinking" to bemourn fake news, and how it competes with well-polished fact-checked intellectual journalism. This, however, should not obscure the fact that all modern communication should be seen as progress. While there are horrifyingly wrong processes occurring in their wake, new media makes us smarter and more knowledgeable, on average.

对于一个有 "深思 "天赋的记者来说，哀悼假新闻，哀悼它如何与经过事实检验的知识性新闻竞争，是非常自然的。然而，这不应该掩盖一个事实，即所有的现代传播都应该被视为进步。虽然在其之后发生了一些可怕的错误过程，但平均而言，新媒体让我们变得更聪明、更有知识。

For starters, Carr claims that Google cannot be used as a substitute for knowledge in our heads. This is largely correct. SuperMemo had to battle the myth of Googleable knowledge ever since its inception. Google is no substitution for associative memory. We can free our memories to some degree, but core knowledge that underlies reasoning must reside in human memory or it loses its power.

首先，卡尔声称， Google 不能用来替代我们头脑中的知识。这一点基本正确。SuperMemo 自成立以来，就不得不与可 Google 知识的迷思进行斗争。 Google 无法替代联想记忆。我们可以在一定程度上解放我们的记忆，但作为推理基础的核心知识必须驻留在人类的记忆中，否则就会失去力量。

Carr claims that multitasking takes away from "deep thinking". "Deep thinking" is a hazy concept. I would like to see it defined more precisely in terms of information processing. Here I can only use it intuitively. In his reasoning, Carr seems to be forming a model of information processing typical for a teenager who hangs around with his smartphone, keeps multitasking between various social media services, sending messages, gossiping, collecting likes and friends, uploading instant photos, and the like. The problem is that the same teen, without the phone, might be just hanging around with friends sipping beer or daydreaming about that gorgeous cheerleader. In that sense, time-wasting and inefficient multitasking is a step ahead. The same teen, instead of paying attention to his teacher of biology, might be reading recent gossip news abouts his favorite celebrity. Here he is likely to discard incomprehensive knowledge of biology that does not satisfy his [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) for scraps of world knowledge smuggled even in the least ambitious tabloid stories. This is again a step forward, on average. It is better to learn from tabloids than to let incomprehensible knowledge float unresisted through inattentive mind.

卡尔称，多任务处理会让人失去 "深度思考"。"深度思考 "是一个模糊的概念。我希望看到它在信息处理方面有更精确的定义。在这里，我只能直观地使用它。在他的推理中，卡尔似乎形成了一个典型的信息处理模型，这个模型就是一个青少年，他拿着智能手机闲逛，不停地在各种社交媒体服务之间进行多任务处理，发送消息、八卦、收集赞和好友、上传即时照片等等。问题是，同样一个少年，如果没有手机，他可能只是和朋友们一起喝着啤酒闲逛，或者做着那个漂亮的啦啦队长的白日梦。从这个意义上说，浪费时间、效率低下的多任务处理方式已经先行一步了。同样的青少年，他可能不是在关注他的生物老师，而是在阅读最近关于他最喜欢的名人的八卦新闻。在这里，他很可能会抛弃不全面的生物学知识，这些知识不能满足他的学习动力，甚至在最没有野心的小报故事中也会偷看世界知识的碎片。这又是一种进步，平均而言。向小报学习，总比让难以理解的知识在不专心的头脑中毫无节制地飘荡要好。

Carr seems to ignore millions of people who use social medial for doing actual work, getting valuable news updates, exchanging valuable information, and the like. The smarter they are, the less they multitask, and the smarter they get. Bemourning Facebook or Twitter is akin to complaining about the existence of cars because accidents kill people.

卡尔似乎忽略了数以百万计的人，他们使用社交媒体做实际工作，获取有价值的新闻更新，交流有价值的信息，等等。他们越聪明，多任务越少，越聪明。哀悼 Facebook 或 Twitter 就像抱怨汽车的存在一样，因为事故会害死人。

A huge wave of disappointment with the alleged decline of human knowledge and human intelligence came with a recent swing to the right, or to the left in recent elections, referenda, or polls of electoral prospects around the world.

最近在世界各地的选举、公投或选举前景的民调中，出现了向右或向左摇摆的情况，对所谓的人类知识和人类智慧的下降，感到失望的巨大浪潮。

# Smarter sum of dumber usership 更聪明的笨用户的总和

Brexit and Trump do not mean masses get dumber! Just the opposite. Masses get smarter. The average knowledge of an average Internet user might have dropped indeed. This is simply because of the fact that those with lesser smarts or lesser education have joined the bandwagon. They still get smarter because of their online access. For each stupid online falsehood, they get two corrections in terms of the truth. Wikipedia is the core of the net knowledge today. It contains lots of falsehoods and simplifications, but it is getting better by the minute. It is the shiniest example of the wisdom of the crowds. Most people have heard of Wikipedia. More and more people use it. We are converging on the truth. The size of available knowledge grows fast. The news is good. We should not fear biased sectarian homeschoolers. The are bound to be far more open to the world than it was a case a decade ago.

英国脱欧和特朗普并不意味着大众变笨！恰恰相反。大众变得更聪明了。一个普通网民的平均知识水平可能确实下降了。这只是因为那些智商较低或教育程度较低的人加入了这个行列。他们还是因为上网而变得更聪明。对于每一个愚蠢的网上谎言，他们都会得到两个关于真相的更正。维基百科是当今网络知识的核心。它包含了很多虚假和简化的内容，但它正日渐完善。它是众人智慧的最闪亮的例子。大多数人都听说过维基百科。越来越多的人在使用它。我们正在收敛于真理。现有知识的规模快速增长。这个消息是好的。我们不应该害怕有偏见的教派家庭教育者。他们一定会比十年前的情况更开放。

If there is knowledge convergence, you may ask, why does research show that political debates get hotter in proportion to the degree of well-informedness? The heat of the debate follows a U-shaped curve. For zero knowledge, there is no debate. For complete knowledge, there is a perfect agreement. For complex knowledge, like "*Is Brexit good?*", we are all closer to the point of ignorance. Adding information is like adding fuel to the fire. The sides only tighten their ranks and turn livid.

如果知识收敛，你可能会问，为什么研究表明，政治辩论的热度与信息充分的程度成正比？辩论的热度遵循一条U型曲线。对于零知识，不存在辩论。对于完全的知识，则完全一致。对于复杂的知识，比如 "脱欧好吗？"，我们都更接近无知的地步。添加信息就像火上浇油。双方只会步步紧逼，变本加厉。

If you Google for Brexit or Trump, relevant Wikipedia entries will come on top. This is knowledge that even the smartest political pundit may not be entirely familiar with. This is knowledge that most people would and should gladly take on board and feel smarter. It is reasonably balanced between the points of view of all sides. It is far better a compilation than the models of reality most of people carry in their heads. Carr would probably deny it. After all, he is on Britannica's board of advisors. With all good intentions and a great deal of valid argument, Carr is an information Luddite of the web era. In the world of fast progress, few people can afford to finish reading [Anna Karenina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Karenina). The book has not lost its value. It is just the choice that got wider and richer.

如果你在 Google 上搜索脱欧或特朗普，相关的维基百科条目就会出现在上面。这是连最聪明的政治评论家都未必完全熟悉的知识。这是大多数人都会而且应该欣然接受并觉得自己更聪明的知识。这是各方观点之间的合理平衡。这比大多数人脑海中的现实模型要好得多。卡尔可能会否认这一点。毕竟，他是《大英百科全书》的顾问委员会成员。卡尔的意图很好，论证也很有道理，但他是一个网络时代的信息路德派。在这个快速进步的世界里，很少有人能读完《安娜-卡列尼娜》。这本书并没有失去它的价值。只是选择的范围更广了，内容更丰富了。

As a contributor to Britannica, Carr is a writer with a point of view. He contributes on subjects that are affected by his point of view. Analogous topics at Wikipedia are a result of crowd powered balance. Richness of Wikipedia is its main strength. To a critical mind, there is more inspiration in 9 pieces of correct information and 1 piece of wrong information than in 2 pieces of correct information. Wikipedia is a great starting point when learning about a new subject. Moreover, Wikipedia is now rich in citations for anyone to verify the source of most weighty claims. It is up to the reader if he makes a good use of the information, or get fooled. Britannica may indeed be better for people with lower ability to critically process information. However, Wikipedia's accuracy keeps increasing. Today, it seems unbeatable.

作为《大英百科》的撰稿人，卡尔是一个有观点的作家。他贡献的主题受他的观点影响。维基百科的类似主题是人群动力平衡的结果。维基百科的丰富性是其主要优势。对一个批判性思维来说，9 条正确信息和 1 条错误信息比 2 条正确信息有更多的启发。在学习一个新的课题时，维基百科是一个很好的起点。此外，维基百科现在有丰富的引文，任何人都可以验证大多数重量级说法的来源。读者是好好利用这些信息，还是上当受骗，就看他自己了。对于批判性处理信息的能力较低的人来说，《大英百科》可能确实比较好。但是，维基百科的准确率不断提高。今天，它似乎是无可匹敌的。

# Wikipedia vs. Britannica 维基百科与大英百科

The battle over the superiority of Britannica is nearly two decades old. Today the verdict is pretty easy to settle. Here are two definitions of sleep from Wikipedia and Encyclopedia Britannica. Which one is better in your view?

大英百科的优胜劣汰之争已经有近二十年的历史了。如今，这个判断很容易解决。以下是维基百科和大英百科对睡眠的两个定义。在你看来，哪一个更好？

> **Source 1**: Sleep, a normal, reversible, recurrent state of reduced responsiveness to external stimulation that is accompanied by complex and predictable changes in physiology. These changes include coordinated, spontaneous, and internally generated brain activity as well as fluctuations in hormone levels and relaxation of musculature. A succinctly defined specific purpose of sleep remains unclear, but that is partly because sleep is a dynamic state that influences all physiology, rather than an individual organ or other isolated physical system. Sleep contrasts with wakefulness, in which state there is an enhanced potential for sensitivity and an efficient responsiveness to external stimuli. The sleep-wakefulness alternation is the most-striking manifestation in higher vertebrates of the more-general phenomenon of periodicity in the activity or responsivity of living tissue.
>
> **来源 1**：睡眠，是一种正常的、可逆的、反复出现的对外界刺激的反应性降低的状态，伴随着生理学的复杂和可预测的变化。这些变化包括协调的、自发的、内部产生的大脑活动，以及激素水平的波动和肌肉组织的放松。一个简洁定义的睡眠的具体目的仍然不清楚，但这部分是因为睡眠是一种动态状态，影响所有的生理学，而不是个别器官或其他孤立的物理系统。睡眠与清醒状态形成鲜明对比，在这种状态下，人们对外界刺激的敏感潜力增强，反应效率高。睡眠-觉醒交替是高等脊椎动物在活体组织活动或反应能力的周期性这一较为普遍的现象中最突出的表现。

Perhaps this one is better?

也许这个更好？

> **Source 2**: Sleep is a naturally recurring state of mind and body characterized by altered consciousness, relatively inhibited sensory activity, inhibition of nearly all voluntary muscles, and reduced interactions with surroundings. It is distinguished from wakefulness by a decreased ability to react to stimuli, but is more easily reversed than the state of hibernation or of being comatose. Mammalian sleep occurs in repeating periods, in which the body alternates between two highly distinct modes known as non-REM and REM sleep. REM stands for "rapid eye movement" but involves many other aspects including virtual paralysis of the body
>
> **来源 2**：睡眠是一种自然反复的身心状态，其特点是意识改变，感觉活动相对抑制，几乎所有的自主肌肉都受到抑制，与周围环境的相互作用减少。它与清醒的区别在于对刺激的反应能力下降，但比冬眠或昏迷状态更容易逆转。哺乳动物的睡眠是以重复的方式进行的，身体在两种高度不同的模式之间交替进行，即非快速眼动睡眠和快速眼动睡眠。REM代表 "快速眼动"，但也涉及许多其他方面，包括身体的虚拟麻痹。

Do you have a verdict? Hard to say? Google it out and see, which is which. By that time, one of those will probably have improved, the other will likely stay frozen, so you may need two Google tries.

你有定论吗？难以启齿？Google 一下，看看，哪个是哪个。到时候，其中一个可能会有所改善，另一个很可能会保持冻结状态，所以你可能需要尝试 Google 两次。

If this is a close call, go to the chapter on the function of sleep. Here Britannica lags by two decades. It does not include notes on the newest research and is very conservative as to what scientists believe the function of sleep is. Sleep is a form of [neural optimization](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_optimization_in_sleep). This seemed obvious at the end of the last millennium. In 2017, Britannica misses the point entirely with a shy note in the last short paragraph that reduces optimization to mere consolidation: "*experiments have pointed to sleep as playing an essential role in the modification of memories, particularly in making them stronger*". Wikipedia, in the meantime, adds a big chapter with references and links to three independent wiki articles on memory, learning and creativity in sleep.

如果这是千钧一发的情况，请转到睡眠功能一章。在这里，大英百科全书落后了 20 年。它不包括最新研究的笔记，而且对于科学家认为睡眠的功能是什么，这一点非常保守。睡眠是神经优化的一种形式。在上个千年末，这似乎是显而易见的。2017 年，“大英百科全书”完全忽略了这一点，在最后一小段中有一个含蓄的注释，将优化降为纯粹的巩固：“实验表明，睡眠在修改记忆方面发挥着至关重要的作用，特别是在让记忆变得更强方面。”与此同时，维基百科增加了一个很大的章节，里面有三篇关于睡眠中的记忆、学习和创造力的独立维基文章的参考和链接。

Back in 2001, I wrote a few paragraphs for Wikipedia on [neural optimization in sleep](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Neural_optimization_in_sleep). The crowd voted me down, so I had to give it up. I was too progressive for the times. Even the open mind of [Larry Sanger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Sanger) would cross-check with Encarta and remain skeptical. It took a while for Wikipedia to catch up with research. In the meantime, Britannica and Encarta stayed decades behind, and Encarta actually died of its own inertia.

回到 2001 年，我在维基百科上写了几段关于睡眠中的神经优化的文章。群众投票否决了我，所以我只好放弃。我当时太激进了。即使是持开放思想的拉里·桑格也会与安卡塔进行交叉核实，并保持怀疑态度。维基百科花了一段时间才赶上研究的步伐。与此同时，大英百科全书和安卡塔落后了几十年，而安卡塔实际上死于自身的惰性。

For me there is no contest. Wikipedia is already light years ahead of Britannica and this is only going to get worse for the venerable pioneer of printed encyclopedias. If you care about learning, research, or inspiration, you cannot possibly disagree.

对我来说没有竞争。维基百科已经领先《大英百科全书》好几光年了，对于这个值得尊敬的印刷百科全书先驱来说，情况只会变得更糟。如果你关心学习、研究或灵感，你不可能不同意。

# Isolationist homeschooling 孤立主义在家教育

A great deal of motivation for [homeschooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Homeschooling) around the world is to shield the kids from the evils of the world. For some religious fundamentalists, even truthful science carries a great deal of evil knowledge. Ubiquitous Internet makes shielding harder. This is particularly true of shielding with half-truths. It took one book on evolution at the age of 10 to get me out of the class in religion, and [out of my Catholic faith for good](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Ban_on_homeschooling). Today, all human knowledge is just a few clicks away. Parents who wish to retain their kids' purity, not only need to prevent schooling, they need to prevent access to the Internet. This may still be the case in select communities or select families, but it is getting harder and harder. For more see: [Ban on homeschooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Ban_on_homeschooling)

世界各地的家庭教育，很大的动机是为了让孩子们免受世界上的邪恶。对于一些宗教原教旨主义者来说，即使是真理科学也带有大量的邪恶知识。无处不在的互联网让屏蔽变得更加困难。尤其是用半真半假的东西进行屏蔽。10 岁的时候，一本关于进化论的书就把我从宗教的课堂上赶了出来，我也彻底脱离了天主教信仰。如今，人类所有的知识都只需点击几下就能了解。家长如果想保持孩子的纯洁性，不仅要防止上学，还要防止上网。这在选定的社区或选定的家庭可能还是这样，但越来越难了。有关更多信息，请参阅：禁止在家上学

# Fake news and TrustRank 假新闻和 TrustRank

Work is underway to produce crowd-sourced databases of fake and untrustworthy sites. The database could be used in user alerts or prioritization of Facebook feeds. There is a more attractive tool in prospect though.

目前正在开展工作，制作虚假和不可信网站的众包数据库。该数据库可用于用户警报或对 Facebook feeds 进行优先排序。不过还有一个更有吸引力的工具在期待。

I predicted the emergence of TruthRank long before [I wrote about it in 2002](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Bad_learning_contributes_to_Alzheimer's). Google has already announced they are working over a concept named TrustRank. Even [Ray Kurzweil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil) is said to be on the effort (Google’s Director of Engineering). TrustRank is probably a better name than TruthRank. After all, trustworthy sites may publish untruthful information by mistake or before a hypothesis is proven false. Interestingly, [knowledge-based trust correlates with PageRank](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03519.pdf). Climate change deniers, antivaccination activists, and creationists alike, shake in their boots already. So should future Trumps and promoters of future Brexits.

早在 2002 年我就预测到 TruthRank 的出现。 Google 已经宣布他们正在为一个名为 TrustRank 的概念而努力。据说连 Ray Kurzweil 都参与了这项工作（Google 的工程总监）。TrustRank 可能是一个比 TruthRank 更好的名字。毕竟，值得信赖的网站可能会因为错误或在假设被证明是错误的之前发布不真实的信息。有趣的是，基于知识的信任与 PageRank 相关。气候变化否认者，反疫苗活动家和创造论者，已经在他们的靴子里摇晃。未来特朗普和未来脱欧的推动者也应该如此。

The truth is as good as information available. TrustRank might penalize those who refused to believe in weapons of mass destruction in Iraq 2003. They might also penalize those who claimed Trump is a favorite in the US Election 2016. Such biases are inevitable. If intelligence is wrong, or polls are wrong, we may all fail to see the light. What TrustRank will do is to weaken verifiably false memes.

事实是可以获得的最好的信息。TrustRank 可能会惩罚那些拒绝相信 2003 年的伊拉克有大规模杀伤性武器的人。他们还可能惩罚那些声称特朗普是 2016 年美国大选中最受欢迎的人。这种偏见是不可避免的。如果情报是错误的，或者民意调查是错误的，我们可能都看不到曙光。TrustRank 将做的是削弱可证实的虚假迷因。

There will always be funding bias, sponsorship bias, power bias, emotional bias, and a whole host of cognitive biases. We will not root them out. We only want to weaken them using information science.

总会有资金偏见、赞助商偏见、权力偏见、情感偏见，以及一大堆认知偏见。我们不会把他们铲除的。我们只想用信息科学来削弱他们。

For Google, it would makes sense to add a customization option: (a) filter my knowledge by truth rank or (b) feed me with whatever bunk is popular. That will add one more layer of amplification to the truth: the less fortunate minds will get even more confused and weakened in the information battle. In addition, I would love to compare those two filtered and unfiltered worlds. PageRank is already doing a great job in that. I recall the days of AltaVista. I mentioned similar worries about [InfoBabble in my PhD](https://www.super-memory.com/english/ol/knowmachine.htm) the whole two decades ago (1995). Google quashed infobabble in the search space once and for all, and fast. Now we will make another step in the right direction. If Google implements TrustRank poorly, Bing or other competition will step in, however, Google have a good track record and I am optimistic. If they are slow, others might come to the front! In the end, the ultimate hope rests with [Tim Berners-Lee](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) and his Semantic Web. Once we build an intelligent universal global [concept network](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Concept_network), its departures from reality and its own [cognitive biases](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Cognitive_bias) will only reflect the scarcity of data in the universe of all human knowledge of all history.

对于 Google 来说，增加一个定制选项是有意义的：(A)过滤根据真相排名我的知识，或者(B)用流行的东西喂我。这将为事实增加一层放大：不幸的人将在信息战中变得更加困惑和被削弱。此外，我很乐意将这两个经过过滤和未过滤的世界进行比较。PageRank 在这方面已经做得很好了。我回想起 AltaVista 的日子。整整20 年前(1995 年)，我在我的博士学位上都提到过类似的对 InfoBabble 的担忧。 Google 一劳永逸地、迅速地平息了搜索领域的信息混乱。现在我们将朝着正确的方向再迈出一步。如果 Google 对 TrustRank 的实施不佳，必应或其他竞争对手将介入，然而，Google 有良好的记录，我对此持乐观态度。如果他们慢了，其他人可能会走到前面！归根结底，最终的希望寄托在蒂姆·伯纳斯-李和他的语义网身上。一旦我们建立了一个智能的全球通用概念网络，其脱离现实和自身的认知偏差只会反映出所有人类所有历史知识的宇宙中数据的稀缺性。

# Fashion reflects convergence 时尚反映收敛

Radioactivity was so fashionable at some point that it was used in cosmetics. It took many decades to convince populations around the world that smoking is harmful. To this day people and even some physicians believe that you can "[*catch a cold from cold*](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Myth:_We_catch_a_cold_from_cold)". I hear and try to bust that meme daily! The truth is slow but it comes.

放射性在某种程度上是如此时髦，以至于它被用在化妆品中。花了几十年的时间才让世界各地的人们相信吸烟是有害的。时至今日，人们甚至一些医生都相信“受凉会感冒”。我每天都会听到并试图打破这种迷因！真相是缓慢的，但它来了。

[Ngram Viewer](https://books.google.com/ngrams) is a useful tool for analysis of changes in language, culture, and fashion. Scientific terms wax and wane depending on current interests and trends. Pseudoscientific terms tend to peak and never recover from decline. A skeptic may say that the decline comes from the mere fact of being labelled pseudoscientific. Information science says that memes are crippled by falsehoods and the handicap increases with available information due to an increase in probability of associative contradictions.

Ngram Viewer 是分析语言、文化和时尚变化的有用工具。科学术语的兴衰取决于当前的兴趣和趋势。伪科学术语往往会达到顶峰，永远不会从衰落中恢复过来。怀疑论者可能会说，下降仅仅是因为被贴上伪科学标签的事实。信息科学说，迷因被谎言削弱了，而且由于关联矛盾的概率增加，随着可用信息的增加，障碍也增加了。

# Interruption and disruption in SuperMemo SuperMemo 中的中断与打断

Worshipers of "deep reading" and "deep thinking" often complain that humanity slowly degrades its ability to focus. We get the [attention span of a goldfish](http://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish). Superficially, [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading) may seem to fit that picture perfectly. To an observer, it may look like a hurried run between pieces of information in search for some intangible reward. No "deep reading" implies no "deep thinking". [Maryanne Wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryanne_Wolf) even says that "*deep reading is indistinguishable from deep thinking*". If "deep thinking" is understood as contemplation, and uninterrupted analysis, then it needs to be stressed that nothing prevents the user of [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo) to pause and contemplate for an hour over whatever precious text she is reading at the time.

“深度阅读”和“深度思考”的崇拜者经常抱怨人类慢慢降低了专注的能力。我们的注意力持续时间就像一条金鱼。从表面上看，渐进阅读似乎完全符合这一图景。对于观察者来说，这可能看起来像是在信息片段之间匆忙奔跑，以寻找一些无形的回报。没有“深度阅读”就没有“深度思考”。玛丽安·沃尔夫甚至说，“深度阅读与深度思考没有什么区别”。如果“深度思考”被理解为沉思和不间断的分析，那么需要强调的是，没有什么能阻止 SuperMemo 的用户停下来沉思一个小时，无论她当时正在阅读的是什么珍贵的文本。

First of all, **there is no multitasking in [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo)**. [Incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading) makes it possible to read "in parallel", but this means "hundreds of articles go through the process". At any given moment of time, only one article receives focus. This is a full undivided and clear attention on just one piece of text. SuperMemo actually helps avoid multitasking. If the user opens a dozen of tabs in his web browser, SuperMemo makes it possible to import all the tabs as separate articles at set their priorities. They will all be processed independently and with due attention.

首先，SuperMemo 没有多任务处理的功能。渐进阅读使“并行”阅读成为可能，但这意味着“几百篇文章都要走完这个过程”。在任何给定的时刻，只有一篇文章获得关注。这是对一段文字的充分、完整和清晰的关注。SuperMemo 实际上有助于避免多任务处理。如果用户在他的网络浏览器中打开十几个标签，SuperMemo 就可以将所有标签作为单独的文章导入，并设置它们的优先级。它们都将被独立处理，并将给予应有的关注。

[SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo) carries no obligations. It juggles information for the same reason for which TV viewers zap channels, bibliophiles browse a library, readers skim passages of a text, and Internet users open multiple tabs in their browser. Consumers of information search for meaningful messages in the noise of a broadcast. The main difference between chaotic searches and [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading) is that SuperMemo does the search in a systematic manner. No information is lost. No distortion introduced. All knowledge gets [prioritized](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Priority_queue) and processed in due time.

SuperMemo 不承担任何义务。它切换信息的原因与电视观众切换频道、爱书者浏览图书馆、读者浏览文本段落以及互联网用户在浏览器中打开多个选项卡的原因相同。信息消费者在广播的噪音中搜索有意义的消息。混乱搜索和渐进阅读之间的主要区别在于 SuperMemo 以系统的方式进行搜索。不会丢失任何信息。没有引入失真。所有知识都会在适当的时间进行优先排序和处理。

Nicholas Carr complains that modern technologies lead to multitasking which affects the way we think. He cites interruption as one of the villains in this picture. It is important to stress that [interruption is central to the efficiency of incremental learning](http://super-memory.com/help/il.htm#The_value_of_interruption_in_learning). Multitasking and interruption are seen as carrying the overhead cost. Each switch between tasks, each switch of attention carries a cost. Interruption is bad for attention and disrupts focused thinking in problem solving.

尼古拉斯·卡尔抱怨说，现代技术导致了多任务处理，这影响了我们的思维方式。他把中断作为这幅图景中的恶棍之一。需要强调的是，中断是渐进学习效率的核心。多任务和中断被视为承担了管理成本。任务之间的每一次切换，注意力的每一次切换都会带来成本。中断对注意力不利，会打乱解决问题的专注思维。

However, we need to distinguish between **external interruption** and **internal interruption**. An external interruption, which I rather call **disruption**, may come from a call, e-mail, advert, or any other environmental alert. This is quite bad for all forms of intellectual effort. External interruption may be a form of brain exercise, but its costs usually far outweigh the benefit. When focusing on an important job, we should avoid disruption if possible. I personally avoid it religiously. I always work in a silent locked room without a phone or e-mail.

但是，我们需要区分**外部中断**和**内部中断**。外部中断，我称之为打断，可能来自电话、电子邮件、广告或任何其他环境警报。这对所有形式的智力努力都是相当不利的。外部中断可能是大脑锻炼的一种形式，但其代价通常远远大于好处。当我们专注于一项重要的工作时，如果可能的话，我们应该避免打断。我个人很虔诚地避免这样做。我总是在一间安静的锁着的房间里工作，没有电话或电子邮件。

An internal interruption is a norm in [incremental learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_learning). I read most of my texts in [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo). While reading, I may trigger an interruption under a dozen of criteria. These might be:

- the text I read appears to be of low quality. I may deprioritize or delete
- I have extracted the most important information from the text and want to continue with my work, or with other texts. Current text may be processed further at later time, at lower priority, etc.
- the text is hard and burns too deep into my mental resources. I may want to retain some of the resources for other texts in the queue. Hard texts are best read in small portion with maximized focus
- a must-read text is boring and I struggle with maintaining high attention for longer stretches of time

在渐进学习中，内部中断是一种常态。我大部分的文章都是用 SuperMemo 读的。在阅读时，我可能会在十几种情况下中断阅读。这些可能是:

- 我读的文章质量很差。我可能会优先考虑或删除；
- 我已经从文本中提取了最重要的信息，想继续我的工作，或与其他文本。当前的文本可能在以后进一步处理，以较低的优先级，等等；
- 这篇课文太难了，把我的脑力消耗得太深了。我可能想为队列中的其他文本保留一些资源。困难文本最好一小部分阅读，集中注意力；
- 必读的文章很无聊，我很难长时间保持高度集中注意力。

As you can see, no condition implies an obligatory interruption. A fascinating piece of reading that satisfies the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) all the way through may stay in focus for an hour or as long as the brain can sustain the effort.

如您所见，没有任何条件意味着必须中断。一段令人着迷的阅读完全满足了学习的动力，只要大脑能够承受这种努力，它就可以保持专注一个小时。

If these conditions seem trivial, note that there are always hundreds of vital texts in the queue. Every text carries an opportunity cost. Instead of reading text A, I might be reading a more valuable text B. Opportunity costs are best evaluated by reading many texts and prioritizing. Even the most focused bibliophile will preview a book before making a commitment. Even the most focused "deep thinker" will give up a book when it does not satisfy his quality standards.

如果这些条件看起来微不足道，请注意队列中总是有数百个重要文本。每条文本都有机会成本。与其阅读文本 A，我可能正在阅读更有价值的文本 B。机会成本最好通过阅读大量文本并确定优先顺序来评估。即使是最专注的爱书人也会在做出承诺之前预览一本书。即使是最专注的“深度思想家”也会在一本书达不到他的质量标准时放弃。

The costs of switching between texts are negligible in well-managed [incremental learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_learning). Each switch is a form of IQ exercise in context retrieval. With practise, that exercise is waning. Most importantly: **interruption and spacing are vital cost-effective tools in developing long-term memories**. If we read a book today, we may remember little in a year. If we read the same book in chapters spread a month apart, recall may improve dramatically. If we process the same book with [incremental learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_learning), the recall may be excellent. It all depends on the way of processing, priorities, and devoted time.

在管理良好的渐进学习中，在文本之间切换的成本可以忽略不计。每一次转换都是情境提取中智商锻炼的一种形式。随着练习的进行，这种锻炼正在减弱。最重要的是：**中断和间隔是形成长期记忆的重要的高性价比工具**。如果我们今天读一本书，一年中我们可能会记得很少。如果我们把同一本书分成几章，间隔一个月阅读，记忆力可能会显著提高。如果我们用渐进学习来处理同一本书，保留率可能会很高。这完全取决于处理的方式、优先顺序和投入的时间。

Internal interruption has nothing to do with disruption and is a precious tool in making the most of information sources in the long-term. [Incremental learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_learning) boosts contradictory processes: focus and creativity. If focus is poor, e.g. due to a late hour, vital texts can be postponed for better times. If focus is great, the reader can do as much "deep thinking" as necessary. On the other hand, combining pieces of knowledge in [incremental learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_learning), or better yet in [neural creativity](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Neural_creativity), is the best known way to stimulate creativity via information presentation.

内部中断与打断无关，从长远来看，它是最大限度地利用信息来源的宝贵工具。渐进学习促进了相互矛盾的过程：专注和创造力。如果注意力不集中，例如因为太晚了，重要的课文可以推迟到更好的时间。如果专注很好，读者可以根据需要进行尽可能多的“深度思考”。另一方面，在渐进学习中组合知识，或者更好地在神经创造力中组合知识，是通过信息呈现来激发创造力的最著名的方式。

There is no better, no faster, and no more permanent way of reading than [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading).

没有比渐进阅读更好、更快、更持久的阅读方式了。

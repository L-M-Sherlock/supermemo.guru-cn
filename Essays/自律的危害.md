# Harms of self-discipline 自律的危害

## Dangers of self-coercion

## 自我胁迫的危险

**Self-discipline** can be extremely harmful to mental and physical health. The power of the rational brain has been driven to incredible levels. The cortex can override natural defense signals that protect the body from harm. The cortex can interfere with healthy homeostasis.

**自律**可能对身心健康危害极大。理性大脑的力量已经被驱使到不可思议的程度。皮层可以推翻保护身体不受伤害的自然防御信号。皮层可以干扰健康的稳态。

In this text, I would like to focus on harms of [self-discipline](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-discipline) that is advocated by alleged "experts" in self-help and psychology. Some of self-discipline mythology has set its root deep in the modern culture. Only a systematic uprooting of all individual mythical advice can mitigate the harm.

在这篇文字中，我想重点谈谈所谓的自律和心理学 "专家" 所倡导的自律的危害。一些自律迷思已经在现代文化中深深扎下了根。只有系统地连根拔起所有迷思的建议，才能减轻危害。

Self-discipline can be precious or deadly. It all depends on the mode of use

自律可以是珍贵的，也可以是致命的。这一切都取决于使用的模式

## Reward yourself

## 奖励自己

Schools excel at rewarding students for pointless learning. In [schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Schooling), we replace the innate [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) that powers [coherent](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Coherence) learning with a [school drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/School_drive) (i.e. system of rewards and penalties based on performance). In the re-education camps of the Soviet Union, food portions would be assigned in proportion to performance (e.g. production quota). At school, accolades are due to those with [good grades](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Dangers_of_being_a_Straight_A_student). Even smiles and frowns from [teachers](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Teacher) and parents are associated with grades. The old-and-tried approach is to interleave unpleasant learning with rewards. A few minutes of pointless [homework](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Homework) followed by something nice (e.g. a YouTube video). A few minutes of [cramming](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Cramming), followed by candy, and so on. This type of operant conditioning runs on the same principles as animal training. Even a pigeon can learn simple math. However, a pigeon will have no contribution to human innovation.

学校擅长奖励学生进行无意义的学习。在学校教育中，我们用学校的外驱力（即基于表现的奖惩制度）取代了推动连贯学习的先天学习内驱力。在苏联的再教育营中，食物的分量会根据表现按比例分配（如生产配额）。在学校里，成绩好的人就会得到嘉奖。就连老师和家长的微笑和皱眉也与成绩有关。老套的办法是把不愉快的学习与奖励交织在一起。几分钟毫无意义的作业后，再来点好东西（如 YouTube 视频）。几分钟的死记硬背，然后是糖果，以此类推。这种操作性条件的运行原理与动物训练相同。即使是一只鸽子也能学会简单的数学。但是，鸽子对人类的创新不会有任何贡献。

Many self-discipline gurus have adopted that strategy to make people push themselves to work harder even if their brains protest. With a bit of self-discipline and reward, a high achiever will push himself into reading 300 boring books on success, economics, and money. That rubbery brain diet is unpalatable for an unreceptive brain. The educational effect is negligible. Very often, in an act of violent disinhibition, the same individual may give up reading for years. If the brain does not provide a reward, the activity is unlikely to be productive. This is particularly visible in learning. See: [Fundamental Law of Learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Fundamental_Law_of_Learning).

许多自律大师都采用了这种策略，让人们促使自己更加努力工作，即使他们的大脑提出抗议。只要有一点自律和奖励，一个高成就的人就会逼着自己读 300 本关于成功、经济和金钱的无聊书籍。对于一个不善于接受的大脑来说，这种像橡胶一样的大脑饮食是令人不快的。教育效果微乎其微。很多时候，在猛烈的抑制行为中，同一个人可能会放弃阅读多年。如果大脑自身不提供奖励，活动就不可能有成效。这一点在学习中尤其明显。请看：《学习的基本规律》。

Productivity should be its own self-perpetuating reward

生产力应该是其自身的自我延续性奖励

## Polyphasic sleep

## 多相睡眠

As of 2002, I battled a pernicious myth of [polyphasic sleep](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep). Dozens of young men (rarely women), inflicted incredible harm on their [sleep control system](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_control_system). The core of the myth was the alleged ability of the brain to adapt to sleeping a mere 2-3 hours per day. The execution of the plan leading to the mythical Edison sleep was based on **[futile grit](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Futile_grit)**. A young man would torture himself to sleep polyphasically for weeks or months awaiting adaptation. The adaptation would never come as it is biologically impossible. Each individual would have to slay the myth for himself along with thousand of brain cells responsible for the control of sleep (see: [How do we fall asleep?](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_do_we_fall_asleep%3F)).

从 2002 年开始，我就与多相睡眠的恶性迷思作斗争。数十名年轻男子（很少是女性），对他们的睡眠控制系统造成了难以置信的伤害。这个迷思的核心是所谓的大脑能够适应每天只睡 2-3 小时。计划的执行导致了迷思中的爱迪生睡眠，这是建立在**徒劳的毅力**基础上的。一个年轻人会在数周或数月的时间里折磨自己，让自己等待适应多相睡眠。适应永远不会到来，因为这在生物学上是不可能的。每个人都必须为自己和负责控制睡眠的数千个脑细胞杀死这个迷思，（见：我们如何入睡？）

I immodestly claim that I had a strong contribution to slaying the polyphasic sleep myth. This humorous [ancient text](https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/articles/polyphasic) (2005) belongs to one of my proudest achievements in the service of better sleep, health and learning for the young generation. [Polyphasic sleep](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep) is probably the best illustration of **[futile grit](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Futile_grit)** that should rather be called **stupid grit**. For more see: [Polyphasic sleep myths](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep_myths).

我不正经地宣称，我对击杀多相睡眠迷思有很大的贡献。这篇幽默的老文章（2005 年）属于我最自豪的成就之一，为年轻一代更好的睡眠、健康和学习服务。多相睡眠大概是对**徒劳的毅力**最好的说明，不如说是**愚蠢的毅力**。更多内容请看：多相睡眠的迷思。

## Dopamine detox

## 多巴胺戒瘾

**[Dopamine detox](https://www.livescience.com/is-there-science-behind-dopamine-fasting-trend.html)** or **dopamine fasting** is a period in which an individual gives up trivial pleasurable pursuits such as social media, fast food, Netflix, pornography, alcohol, etc. The purpose of the detox is to give the brain a chance to sense natural pleasures that may be less intense, e.g. beauty of nature, conversation with a friend, good sleep, or making orders at home.

**多巴胺戒瘾**或**多巴胺断食**是指个人放弃琐碎的快乐追求，如社交媒体、快餐、Netflix、色情、酒精等。戒瘾的目的是让大脑有机会感受到可能不那么强烈的自然快乐，例如大自然的美、与朋友的交谈、良好的睡眠或在家做单。

The concept makes sense when making orders in a messy life. However, when the detox is extended to [self-discipline](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-discipline) in learning, it neglects the quintessential truth that [good learning is highly pleasurable](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Pleasure_of_learning). **Dopamine detox** might then employ **futile grit** for the sake of unpleasant learning, which is a norm for a typical student in a typical school. This is very harmful! This obscures the need to adhere to the [Fundamental Law of Learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Fundamental_Law_of_Learning). Learning must be pleasurable. We need to cherish the instincts of the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive). Otherwise, we will become insensitive to the pleasure of learning as much as a shift-worker loses the ability to sense high quality sleep, or a yo-yo dieter loses the sense of healthy nutrition. Learning is its best reward and it needs no tools akin to drug rehabilitation.

在凌乱的生活中发号施令时，这个概念是有意义的。然而，当戒瘾扩展到学习中的自律时，就忽略了一个精髓的道理，即好的学习是高度愉悦的。**多巴胺戒瘾**就可能为了不愉快的学习而采用**徒劳的毅力**，这是一个典型学校的典型学生的常态。这是很有害的！这就掩盖了坚持学习基本规律的必要性。学习必须是快乐的。我们要珍惜学习内驱力的本能。否则，我们就会对学习的快乐不敏感，就像一个倒班的工人失去了对高质量睡眠的感应，或者一个溜溜球的减肥者失去了对健康营养的感应一样。学习是其最好的奖励，它不需要类似戒毒的工具。

**Dopamine detox** in learning is like saying: *"if you starve long enough, you will be able to eat food from garbage"*

学习中的**多巴胺戒瘾**就像说。"如果你饿得够久，你就能吃到垃圾中的食物"

After long year of schooling, it is hard to enjoy learning. **Dopamine detox** might increase one's responsiveness to the [pleasure of learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Pleasure_of_learning). It may help one make first baby steps on a new road. However, it won't ever remedy the harm of [cramming](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Cramming) for exams. In good learning, we need the opposite strategy:

经过长年累月的学习，很难享受到学习的乐趣。**多巴胺戒瘾**可能会增加人对学习乐趣的反应能力。它可以帮助一个人在新的道路上迈出第一步。但是，它永远无法弥补补习考试的危害。在好的学习中，我们需要相反的策略：

Pleasure of learning is the outcome of [coherence](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Coherence) and [value](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Knowledge_valuation_network). Dopamine is an ally of efficient learning

学习的乐趣是连贯性和价值的结果。多巴胺是高效学习的盟友。

## Victorious self-sacrifice

## 胜利的自我牺牲

People who seek happiness often end up unhappy. Those who seek comfort tend to mess up their lives. Those observations lead to a self-help suggestion to never take the path of least resistance.

追求幸福的人，最后往往不幸福。追求安逸的人，往往会把生活搞得一团糟。这些观察结果导致了一个自救建议，即永远不要走阻力最小的道路。

In the world of human optimizations, we often assume linear relationships. If a little bit of self-sacrifice improves the outcomes, more self-sacrifice is supposed to be beneficial. As it often is the case in similar circumstances, the relationships is non-linear. In terms of self-sacrifice, we have to observe two things:

在人类优化的世界里，我们常常假设线性关系。如果一点自我牺牲能改善结果，那么更多的自我牺牲应该是有益的。然而在类似的情况下，往往是非线性的关系。在自我牺牲方面，我们要观察到两点：

- a tiny bit of pain may improve chances of success in self-coercion. See: [optimum push zone](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Optimum_push_zone)
- 一点点的痛苦可能会提高自我胁迫的成功率。请看：最佳推进区
- as we arm the mind with knowledge and re-condition the mind towards productivity, the degree of necessary sacrifice keeps decreasing
- 当我们用知识武装头脑，把头脑重新调整为生产力的时候，必要的牺牲程度就会不断降低

Instead of encouraging self-flagellation, we should rather seek high productivity based on high pleasure. People of success often insist they work hard, they sleep little, and their road to the top was a road through hell. They do not appreciate or do not reveal how much pleasure they encountered on the same road. Very often, a degree of pain itself may be pleasurable. When we look at Elon Musk's tired young face, we may suffer an illusion that pain defines genius and high achievement. However, it is the struggle with problems that makes Elon thrive. Problems make Elon happy not because they are hard. They make him happy because his mind is armed with all necessary knowledge and skills to tackle them.

与其鼓励自暴自弃，不如在高快乐的基础上追求高生产力。成功的人往往坚持认为他们工作很努力，他们睡得很少，他们通往巅峰的道路是一条穿越地狱的道路。他们不懂得欣赏或不透露自己在同一条路上遇到了多少快乐。很多时候，一定程度的痛苦本身可能就是快乐的。当我们看着埃隆-马斯克疲惫的年轻面孔时，我们可能会产生一种错觉，认为痛苦定义了天才和高成就。然而，正是与问题的斗争让埃隆茁壮成长。问题让埃隆快乐，不是因为它们很难。它们让他快乐，是因为他的头脑已经被所有必要的知识和技能武装起来，可以解决这些问题。

The true formula for high productivity rests in reconditioning the mind to love hard work. That reconditioning requires incremental progress in which minor steps of minor pain lead to significant rewards. In problem solving, we do not seek hardest problems. We look for the goldilocks zone of maximum returns (see: [Problem valuation network](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Problem_valuation_network)). This is why schools fail to teach problem solving skills. Problem valuation is individual and cannot be imposed from above. Those who preach self-discipline, goals, obstacles, hard work, never giving up and self-sacrifice, will often send young men into a burnout or depression.

高生产力的真正公式在于重新调理心智，使其热爱艰苦的工作。这种重修需要循序渐进的进步，在这种进步中，微小的痛苦的小步骤会带来显著的回报。在解决问题的过程中，我们不寻求最难的问题。我们寻找的是最大回报的金发区（见：问题估值网络）。这就是为什么学校没有教授解决问题的技能。问题估值是个人的，不能从上面强加。那些宣扬自律、目标、障碍、努力、永不放弃、自我牺牲的人，往往会让年轻人陷入倦怠或抑郁。

For the incremental reconditioning towards enjoying hard work, we need to retain sensitivity of the brain to signals of pleasure and pain. This is why hard labor and high pain are injurious. They destroy the precious guidance system. Even the hardest workaholic will tell you that you need to love what you do if you want to be successful.

为了渐渐地重新调整，走向享受艰苦的工作，我们需要保留大脑对快乐和痛苦信号的敏感性。这就是为什么艰苦的劳动和高痛苦是伤害性的。它们破坏了珍贵的引导系统。即使是最努力的工作狂也会告诉你，如果你想获得成功，你需要热爱你的工作。

High productivity is fueled by passions and pleasure. Self-sacrifice may turn out counterproductive

高生产力是由激情和快乐所推动的。自我牺牲可能会适得其反。

## 5 am workout

## 早上 5 点锻炼

Early morning workout has been glorified for decades. I was also mesmerized by Rocky who could drag his heavy behind from bed before sunrise and do his miles in a thick hoodie. When I tried to replicated the feat, I suffered serious dehydration, first round loss in a boxing fight, and a week of irregular heartbeat.

早起锻炼已经被美化了几十年。我也被洛基迷住了，他能在天亮前从床上拖着沉重的后背，穿着厚厚的连帽衫跑上几公里。当我试图复制这一壮举时，我遭受了严重的脱水，拳击比赛中第一轮失利，以及一周的心跳不规律。

A decade later I was smarter. When I started studying computer science, I had a well disciplined plan to attend all lectures, soak in knowledge and be a [Straight A student](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Dangers_of_being_a_Straight_A_student). Soon, I discovered that getting up at 7 am is pretty painful. During my morning lectures I was more ready to sleep than to learn. Lectures became a sheer waste of time. However, I found a solution. Instead of going to school by bus, I would run. I would arrive hot and sweaty, take a cold "shower" (in a toilet sink), and be brisk and ready for the first lecture. Fresh air and adrenaline have a miraculous impact on the brain. Unfortunately, by the time of the second lecture, my freshness would be gone and my run would only make me doubly sleepy. It did not take long for me to discover that getting good sleep is more important for brainwork than lectures or jogging.

十年后，我更聪明了。当我开始学习计算机科学时，我有一个很好的纪律性计划，参加所有的讲座，泡在知识中，做一个全 A 学生。很快，我发现，早上 7 点起床是相当痛苦的。在上午的讲座中，我更愿意睡觉，而不是学习。讲座成了纯粹的浪费时间。不过，我找到了一个解决办法。我不坐公交车去学校，而是跑步。到了学校后，我满头大汗，冲个冷水澡（在厕所的水槽里），然后精神抖擞地准备去听第一堂课。新鲜的空气和肾上腺素对大脑有神奇的影响。可惜的是，到了第二场讲座时，我的新鲜感将荡然无存，跑步只会让我倍感困倦。没过多久，我就发现，对于脑力劳动来说，睡好觉比讲课、慢跑更重要。

With each decade, I made minor adjustment to my exercise schedule, and arrived at the day when my ideal time for exercise is the 4th hour of the day (see: [circadian phase](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian_phase)). There is no other time of day that exercise makes sense (for me).

每过十年，我都会对自己的运动时间进行细微的调整，并得出一天中最理想的运动时间是一天中的第 4 个小时（见：昼夜节律位相）。一天中没有其他时间的运动是有意义的（对我来说）。

For those who need to get to work early, there are some benefits to 5 am workout. However, it can only be considered helpful if the [sleep cycle](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian_cycle) is adapted to getting up at 4 am without an [alarm clock](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Alarm_clock). Moreover, early workout increases the risk of injury. It also takes away the best creative slot that is best consumed without exercise or while walking.

对于那些需要早起上班的人来说，早上 5 点锻炼有一定的好处。但是，只有在睡眠周期适应了凌晨 4 点起床而不需要闹钟的情况下，才可以认为是有帮助的。此外，早起锻炼会增加受伤的风险。它还会夺走最好的创意档期，而这个档期最好是在不运动或散步时消耗。

I have no statistics and can only make a wild guess that for most people engaging in 5 am workout, there is a great deal of harm accompanying the well-know benefits. For the workout to make sense, it must follow natural waking and it must be reasonably enjoyable (incl. the pleasure of pain). It should also result in a net boost to brain power in the hours that follow. Sadly, this rarely seems to be the case. The main indicator of trouble among my colleagues who engage in early workout are injuries and fatigue.

我没有统计数据，只能胡乱猜测，对于大多数进行凌晨 5 点锻炼的人来说，在得到众所周知的好处的同时，也伴随着很大的伤害。为了使锻炼有意义，它必须遵循自然醒觉，而且必须是合理的享受（包括痛苦的快乐）。它还应该导致在接下来的几个小时里脑力的净提升。可悲的是，这种情况似乎很少发生。在我的同事中，从事早锻炼的主要麻烦指标是受伤和疲劳。

To be beneficial, early morning exercise requires a great deal of expertise and experience

早起锻炼要想有好处，需要大量的专业知识和经验积累

## Early rising

## 早起

Early rising is very popular among high achievers. Early rising may be conducive for high productivity. However, for early rising to be beneficial, it needs to be healthy. If early rising involves an [alarm clock](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Alarm_clock), it is a violation of sleep hygiene. Healthy rising must come with a natural termination of sleep, and must be based on a correct [circadian](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian) alignment. It is true that the stress of alarm clock can whip in some self-discipline. However, if this discipline contributes to accelerated neuronal death, esp. in control systems responsible for the defense against unhealthy behaviors, we may observe an increase in short-term productivity that consumes longevity and lifelong productivity.

早起是很受高材生欢迎的。早起可能有利于提高工作效率。但是，要想早起有益，需要健康。如果早起涉及到闹钟，那就是违反了睡眠卫生。健康的早起必须伴随着睡眠的自然终止，必须建立在正确的昼夜调整基础上。闹钟的压力确实可以鞭策一些自律。然而，如果这种纪律有助于加速神经元的死亡，特别是在负责防御不健康行为的控制系统中，我们可能会观察到短期生产力的增加，而消耗长寿和终身生产力。

[Free running sleep](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_running_sleep) and natural rising help maximize creative productivity

自由运行的睡眠和自然醒觉有助于最大限度地提高创造性的生产力

## Avoid the snooze button

## 避免使用打盹按钮

People who interrupt their sleep with the [alarm clock](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Alarm_clock) experience a serious [war of the networks](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/War_of_the_networks) in the morning. Their brain screams for sleep, while their [self-discipline](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Self-discipline) calls for getting up. From a biological point of view, it is very hard to say if a snooze makes sense. It depends on too many variables. A very short snooze may be harmful as it can result in a further disruption and a battle with the [sleep control system](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Sleep_control_system). On the other hand, a longer snooze might make it possible to run a full cycle of sleep with some positive effect. A very shallow wake may be less disruptive than getting wide awake for half a minute. All those detailed analysis make little sense, however, in the light of the only healthy strategy:

被闹钟打断睡眠的人，早上会经历一场严重的网络战争。他们的大脑在叫嚣着要睡觉，而他们的自律却在呼唤着起床。从生物学的角度来看，很难说打盹是否有意义。它取决于太多变数。很短的打盹可能是有害的，因为它可能导致进一步的干扰，并与睡眠控制系统进行斗争。另一方面，一个较长的打盹可能会使它有可能运行一个完整的睡眠周期，并产生一些积极的影响。很浅的唤醒可能比半分钟就大醒的干扰要小。然而，在唯一的健康策略面前，所有这些详细的分析都没有什么意义：

Natural sleep should never be interrupted with an [alarm clock](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Alarm_clock)

自然的睡眠永远不应该被闹钟打断

In the era when the most precious property of the brain is [creativity](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Creativity), violations of the [natural creativity cycle](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Natural_creativity_cycle) are undermining personal long-term success. Neither alarm nor a snooze button have place in a healthy lifestyle equation. If they combine with the idea that early rising improves self-discipline and self-discipline is the key to success, we may actually end up with a formula for the accelerated aging of the brain. This is how self-discipline may have a hand in neurodegenerative disorders. See: [Bad learning contributes to Alzheimer's](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Bad_learning_contributes_to_Alzheimer's)

在大脑最宝贵的财产是创造力的时代，违反自然创造力周期正在破坏个人的长期成功。闹钟和打盹按钮在健康的生活方式方程式中都没有地位。如果它们与早起可以提高自律性，而自律性是成功的关键这一观点结合起来，我们最终可能真的会得到一个加速大脑衰老的公式。这就是自律可能与神经退行性疾病有关的原因。请看：坏的学习会导致老年痴呆症

## Employ delayed gratification

## 使用延迟满足

Productivity gurus will tell you to integrate delayed gratification. However, when it comes to learning, creativity, or [problem solving](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Problem_solving), the opposite rule should be employed: if you feel passionate about working on a problem, do it now. Passions are volatile. Forgetting undermines strategies and productivity. The highest achievement is often a result of an inspirational moment. It can be incredibly rewarding and pleasurable. This is the type of instant gratification we should embrace and cherish. It has nothing to do with gobbling a creamy cake.

生产力大师会告诉你要将延迟满足整合进自己。然而，当涉及到学习、创造力或解决问题时，应该采用相反的规则：如果你对工作中的问题感到热情，现在就去做。激情是不稳定的。遗忘会破坏策略和生产力。最高的成就往往是一个灵感时刻的结果。它可以带来难以置信的回报和愉悦。这就是我们应该拥抱和珍惜的即时满足感。它与狼吞虎咽的奶油蛋糕无关。

Instant creative gratification is what makes lives happy and productive

瞬间的创造性满足是使生活快乐和富有成效的原因

## Do not nap

## 不要午睡

Tony Robbins tells you to replace a nap urge with push ups. This advice makes sense only in some contexts, esp. if you are in an environment that makes napping impossible. My contrary rule that should rather take precedence is to **replace a nap urge with a fresh mind by … taking a nap** (see: [Biphasic life](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Biphasic_life)). Pushups provide a dose of adrenaline, which can energize the mind for a moment. However, adrenaline does not remedy the [Swiss cheese problem](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Swiss_cheese_problem). Cortical performance deficits can partly be remedied by rest or change of activity. However, they are best remedied with [slow wave sleep](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/NREM). Doing pushups is not different than whipping a tired horse. Even a dying horse can make that one last spurt. However, the brain does not like to be whipped, and all whipping in the [Swiss cheese state](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Swiss_cheese_state) can have negative consequences for neuronal health. Even if you do not care about long-term brain health, your creative productivity at the moment can also be dramatically improved with a nap.

托尼-罗宾斯告诉你，用俯卧撑代替午睡的冲动。这个建议只有在某些情况下才有意义，特别是如果你处在一个让人无法午睡的环境中。我有与之相反的规则，即宁可优先考虑，**通过...睡午觉来代替午睡的冲动**（见：双相生活）。俯卧撑提供了一定剂量的肾上腺素，可以使头脑一时充满能量。然而，肾上腺素并不能补救瑞士奶酪的问题。皮质表现缺陷可以通过休息或改变活动来部分补救。然而，它们最好用慢波睡眠来补救。做俯卧撑与鞭打一匹疲惫的马没有什么不同。即使是一匹垂死的马，也能使出那最后的气力。然而，大脑不喜欢被鞭打，所有在瑞士奶酪状态下的鞭打都会对神经元的健康产生负面影响。即使你不关心长期的大脑健康，你当下的创造性生产力也可以通过午睡得到显著提高。

Napping should be avoided at times when it could affect the [circadian cycle](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian_cycle). See: [Best time for napping](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Best_time_for_napping). In particular, late evening naps are particularly harmful. When there is a productivity drop due to a dip in alertness at [circadian phase](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Circadian_phase) 10 or later, the best strategy is to give up important mental work for the day. The right strategy is to survive the rest of the day with intellectually unchallenging activities (e.g. walk, socializing, etc.).

应避免在可能影响昼夜周期的时候午睡。请看：午睡的最佳时间。尤其是傍晚时分的午睡，对人体的危害特别大。当昼夜位相 10 或更晚时，由于警觉性下降而导致生产力下降时，最好的策略是放弃当天重要的脑力劳动。正确的策略是以智力上没有挑战的活动（如散步、社交等）来度过一天的剩余时间。

When productivity gurus tell you not to nap, or advise dozens of strategies that will help you survive without napping, you know that they are not to familiar with the mechanics of the creative brain. Instead, see: [Power nap](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Power_nap).

当生产力大师们告诉你不要午睡，或者建议几十种策略可以帮助你在不午睡的情况下生存下去，你就知道他们对创造性大脑的机制并不熟悉。相反，请看：能量午睡。

Smart napping is a fantastic productivity tool

聪明的午睡是一种神奇的生产力工具

## Keep reiterating goals

## 不断重申目标

The idea of sitting down to re-list one's goals seems like an important component of a self-disciplined ritual. However, it begs the questions: if goals are important, why would they need to be reiterated? Goals are essential in well-directed action as they power the entire knowledge valuation tree. However, if they are consistently worked on, they seem to become so well integrated with one's thoughts and behaviors that they need no self-discipline or reminder. I tend to believe that if one needs to keep reviewing one's goal list, there is an inherent problem with valuations. The mere act of reiteration seems like a form of coercion on oneself. When it comes to goals, the extent of the [push zone](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Push_zone) should probably be just about zero. I would naturally provide an exception to fresh graduates and [drop outs](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Drop_out) who have been lead by the hand for too long. Nothing kills goal valuations more efficiently than the interference from people and institutions who impose goals on an individual.

坐下来重新列出自己的目标的想法似乎是自律仪式的一个重要组成部分。然而，这就引出了这样的问题：如果目标很重要，为什么还要重申这些目标？目标在指导良好的行动中是必不可少的，因为它们是整个知识价值树的动力。然而，如果坚持不懈地去做，它们似乎会与一个人的思想和行为融为一体，以至于不需要自律或提醒。我倾向于认为，如果一个人需要不断地回顾自己的目标清单，那么估值就存在着内在的问题。仅仅是复盘的行为，就像是对自己的一种强制。说到目标，推动区的范围大概应该只是零。我自然会给那些被手牵着走太久的应届毕业生和落榜生一个例外。没有什么比那些把目标强加给个人的人和机构的干扰更有效地扼杀目标估值了。

## TV abstinence

## 电视禁欲

For many people, TV is an awful waste of time. Those who throw away a TV set to purify their life may reap a great deal of benefit. However, TV is also a source of great education. When combined with [incremental video](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_video), it can form a fantastic complement to [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading). When I study memory or sleep, I do not bank on TV. However, when it comes to learning history, which is just a hobby, few sources can compete with National Geographic or History Channel. When a self-help guru tells you to stop watching TV, he may violate the rule of employing the [optimum push zone](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Optimum_push_zone) in self-discipline. It is far easier to make incremental changes in one's life. A better rule might be to stop watching reality TV, soap operas, or game shows. Or to stop watching TV live so that it did not dictate the schedule. A bit of fun TV before sleep may actually be healthier than self-disciplined reading of a book about *"financial success"*.

对于很多人来说，电视是一种可怕的时间浪费。那些为了净化生活而扔掉电视机的人，可能会得到很大的好处。然而，电视也是一种很好的教育资源。如果与渐进视频相结合，可以形成渐进阅读的绝妙补充。当我研究记忆或睡眠时，我不指望电视。。然而，当谈到学习历史，这只是一个爱好，很少有资源可以与国家地理或历史频道竞争。当一个自律大师告诉你停止看电视时，他可能违反了自律中采用最佳推动区的规则。在一个人的生活中进行渐进式的改变要容易得多。更好的规则可能是停止看真人秀、肥皂剧或游戏节目。或者停止看电视直播，这样它就没有支配日程。睡觉前看点好玩的电视，其实可能比自律地读一本关于 "财务成功" 的书更健康。

Throwing away a TV set is a bit like closing a library just because most of the bookshelves are loaded with trash. Admittedly, I committed a similar radical throw-away act. I threw away the concept of a car from my life. In my eyes, however, the benefits far outweigh costs. After years of abstinence, the costs are really not perceivable. As always, everyone needs to make similar decisions using the best guidance of his [knowledge valuation network](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Knowledge_valuation_network), colloquially known as *"the nose"*.

扔掉一台电视机，有点像关闭一个图书馆，只因为大部分书架上都是垃圾。诚然，我也曾做出过类似的激进扔掉行为。我把汽车的概念从我的生活中扔掉了。然而，在我眼里，好处远远大于成本。经过多年的禁欲，成本真的无法感知。一如既往，每个人都需要利用他的知识估值网络（俗称 "鼻子"）的最佳指导，做出类似的决定。

Self-discipline at school is harmful

学校的自律是有害的

[Discipline](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Discipline) and self-discipline at school are good for grades, accolades, and certificates (see: [Dangers of being a Straight A student](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Dangers_of_being_a_Straight_A_student)). On the other hand, self-discipline is awful for the [love of learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Pleasure_of_learning). As a result, it systematically erodes student's ability to employ the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) in efficient learning. In the long-run, [compulsory schooling](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling) undermines lifelong learning, adaptation to social life, and healthy productivity. Compulsory schooling has a major contribution to addictions, depression, and other mental health disorders. [Compulsory schooling must end](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Compulsory_schooling_must_end).

在学校里，纪律和自律对成绩、荣誉和证书都有好处（请看：做全 A 学生的危害）。另一方面，自律对于热爱学习是可怕的。因此，它从制度上削弱了学生在高效学习中运用学习内驱力的能力。从长远来看，义务教育破坏了学生的终身学习、适应社会生活和健康的生产力。义务教育对成瘾、抑郁症和其他心理健康疾病有很大的促进作用。义务教育必须终止。
